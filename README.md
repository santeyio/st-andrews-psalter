# psalter

This is the Coverdale Psalter put to modified Gregorian tones by Jeffrey Cooper put into progressive web app format. I use these psalms daily, and it's kind of a pain to scroll through the PDF I have so I decided to put them into PWA so I can use them easier. I've been wanting to experiment with some of this PWA stuff as well, so interests aligned.
