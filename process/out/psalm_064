5

Hear my voice, O God, in my __prayer__; *
preserve my life from __fear of the__ enemy.

2 Hide me from the gathering together of the __fro__ward, *
and from the insurrection of __wicked__ doers;

3 Who have whet their tongue like a __sword__, *
and shoot out their arrows, __even__ bitter words;

4 That they may privily shoot at him that is __per__fect: *
suddenly do they __hit him, and__ fear not.

5 They encourage themselves in __mis__chief, *
and commune among themselves, how they may lay snares;
  and say, that no __man shall__ see them.

6 They imagine wickedness, and __prac__tice it; *
that they keep secret among themselves,
  every man in the __deep of__ his heart.

7 But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift __ar__row, *
that __they shall be__ wounded.

8 Yea, their own tongues shall make them __fall__; *
insomuch that whoso seeth them shall __laugh them__ to scorn.

9 And all men that see it shall say, This hath God __done__; *
for they shall perceive that __it is__ his work.

10 The righteous shall rejoice in the LORD , and put his __trust__ in him; *
and all they that are true of __heart shall__ be glad.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world without__ end. Amen.
