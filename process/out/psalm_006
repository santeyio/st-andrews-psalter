4

O LORD , rebuke me not in thine __indig__nation, *
neither chasten me __in thy__ displeasure.

2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD , for __I am__ weak; *
O LORD , heal __me, for__ my bones are vexed.

3 My soul also __is sore__ troubled: *
but, LORD , __how long wilt__ thou punish me?

4 Turn thee, O LORD , and de__liver my__ soul; *
O save __me, for__ thy mercy's sake.

5 For in death no __man re__membereth thee; *
and who will give __thee thanks__ in the pit?

6 I am weary __of my__ groaning; *
every night wash I my bed, and water __my couch__ with my tears.

7 My beauty is gone for __very__ trouble, *
and worn away because __of all__ mine enemies.

8 Away from me, all ye that __work in__iquity; *
for the LORD hath heard __the voice of__ my weeping.

9 The LORD hath heard __my pe__tition; *
__the LORD will__ receive my prayer.

10 All mine enemies shall be confounded, __and sore__ vexed; *
they shall be turned back, __and put to__ shame suddenly.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
