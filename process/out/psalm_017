4

Hear the right, O LORD , consider __my com__plaint, *
and hearken unto my prayer, that goeth __not out__ of feigned lips.

2 Let my sentence come forth __from thy__ presence; *
and let thine eyes look upon __the thing that__ is equal.

3 Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night season;
  thou hast tried me, and shalt find no __wickedness__ in me; *
for I am utterly purposed that __my mouth__ shall not offend.

4 As for the __works of__ men, *
by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the ways __of the__
destroyer.

5 O hold thou up my goings __in thy__ paths, *
that __my foot__steps slip not.

6 I have called upon thee, O God, for __thou shalt__ hear me: *
incline thine ear to me, and heark__en un__to my words.

7 Show thy marvellous loving-kindness,
  thou that art the Saviour of them which __put their__ trust in thee, *
from such as __resist__ thy right hand.

8 Keep me as the apple __of an__ eye; *
hide me under __the sha__dow of thy wings,

9 From the un__godly, that__ trouble me; *
mine enemies compass me round about, __to take__ away my soul.

10 They are inclosed in __their own__ fat, *
and their __mouth speak__eth proud things.

11 They lie waiting in our way on __every__ side, *
watching to cast __us down__ to the ground;

12 Like as a lion that is greedy __of his__ prey, *
and as it were a lion's whelp lurking __in se__cret places.

13 Up, LORD , disappoint him, and __cast him__ down; *
deliver my soul from the ungod__ly, by__ thine own sword;

14 Yea, by thy hand, O LORD ; from the men of the __evil__ world; *
which have their portion in this life,
  whose bellies thou fillest __with thy__ hid treasure.

15 They have children at __their de__sire, *
and leave the rest of __their sub__stance for their babes.

16 But as for me, I shall behold thy __presence in__ righteousness; *
and when I awake up after thy likeness, __I shall__ be satisfied.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Ho__ly Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
