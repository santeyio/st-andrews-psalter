5

O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the __world__;
* thou that hast set thy glory a__bove the__ heavens!

2 Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
strength,
  because of thine __en__emies, *
that thou mightest still the enemy __and the a__venger.

3 When I consider thy heavens, even the work of thy __fin__gers; *
the moon and the stars which __thou hast__ ordained;

4 What is man, that thou art __mind__ful of him? *
and the son of man, __that thou__ visitest him?

5 Thou madest him lower than the __an__gels, *
to crown him with __glory and__ worship.

6 Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy __hands__; *
and thou hast put all things in subjection __under__ his feet:

7 All sheep and __ox__en; *
yea, and the __beasts of__ the field;

8 The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the __sea__; *
and whatsoever walketh through the __paths of__ the seas.

9 O LORD our __Go__vernor, *
how excellent is thy __Name in__ all the world!

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world without__ end. Amen.
