5

LORD , who shall dwell in thy __ta__bernacle? *
or who shall rest up__on thy__ holy hill?

2 Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt __life__, *
and doeth the thing which is right,
  and speaketh the __truth from__ his heart.

3 He that hath used no deceit in his tongue,
  nor done evil to his __neigh__bour, *
and hath not __slandered his__ neighbour.

4 He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own __eyes__, *
and maketh much of __them that__ fear the LORD .

5 He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him __not__, *
though it were to __his own__ hindrance.

6 He that hath not given his money upon __us__ury, *
nor taken reward a__gainst the__ innocent.

7 Whoso doeth these __things__ *
__shall ne__ver fall.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world without__ end. Amen.
