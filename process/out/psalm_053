2

The foolish body hath said in his __heart__, *
There __is__ no God.

2 Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their __wick__edness; *
there is none that __do__eth good.

3 God looked down from heaven upon the children of __men__, *
to see if there were any that would understand, and __seek af__ter God.

4 But they are all gone out of the way,
  they are altogether become a__bo__minable; *
there is also none that doeth good, __no__ not one.

5 Are not they without understanding that work __wick__edness, *
eating up my people as if they would eat bread?
  they have not __called up__on God.

6 They were afraid where no fear __was__; *
for God hath broken the bones of him that besieged thee;
  thou hast put them to confusion, because God __hath__ despised them.

7 O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of __Si__on! *
O that the Lord would deliver his people __out of__ captivity!

8 Then should Jacob re__joice__, *
  and Israel should __be__ right glad.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world without __end__. Amen.
