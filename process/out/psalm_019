7

The heavens declare the __glory__ of God; *
and the firmament __showeth his__ handy-work.

2 One day __telleth an__other; *
and one night certi__fieth an__other.

3 There is neither __speech nor__ language; *
but their voices are __heard a__mong them.

4 Their sound is gone __out in__to all lands; *
and their words into the __ends of__ the world.

5 In them hath he set a __tabernacle__ for the sun; *
which cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber,
  and rejoiceth as a __giant to__ run his course.

6 It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven,
  and runneth about unto the __end of__ it again; *
and there is nothing __hid from the__ heat thereof.

7 The law of the LORD is an undefiled law, con__verting__ the soul; *
the testimony of the LORD is sure,
  and giveth wisdom __unto the__ simple.

8 The statutes of the LORD are __right, and re__joice the heart; *
the commandment of the LORD is pure,
  and giveth __light un__to the eyes.

9 The fear of the LORD is clean, and en__dureth for__ ever; *
the judgments of the LORD are true, and righteous __alto__gether.

10 More to be desired are they than gold, __yea, than__ much fine gold;
* sweeter also than honey, __and the__ honeycomb.

11 Moreover, by __them is thy__ servant taught; *
and in keeping of them __there is__ great reward.

12 Who can tell how __oft he of__fendeth? *
O cleanse thou me __from my__ secret faults.

13 Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins,
  lest they get the do__minion__ over me; *
so shall I be undefiled, and innocent __from the__ great offence.

14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart,
  be alway ac__ceptable__ in thy sight, *
O LORD , my strength and __my re__deemer.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world without__ end. Amen.
