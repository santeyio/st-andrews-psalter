5

Why boastest thou thyself, thou __ty__rant, *
that thou __canst do__ mischief;

2 Whereas the goodness of __God__ *
en__dureth yet__ daily?

3 Thy tongue imagineth __wick__edness, *
and with lies thou cuttest __like a sharp__ razor.

4 Thou hast loved unrighteousness more than __good__ness, *
and falsehood __more than__ righteousness.

5 Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do __hurt__, *
__O thou__ false tongue.

6 Therefore shall God destroy thee for __ev__er; *
he shall take thee, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling,
  and root thee out of the __land of the__ living.

7 The righteous also shall see this, and __fear__, *
and shall __laugh him__ to scorn:

8 Lo, this is the man that took not God for his __strength__; *
but trusted unto the multitude of his riches,
  and strengthened himself __in his__ wickedness.

9 As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of __God__; *
my trust is in the tender mercy of God for __ever and__ ever.

10 I will alway give thanks unto thee for that thou hast __done__; *
and I will hope in thy Name, for thy __saints like__ it well.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world without__ end. Amen.
