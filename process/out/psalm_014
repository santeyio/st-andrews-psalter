2

The fool hath said in his __heart__, *
There __is__ no God.

2 They are corrupt, and become abominable in their __do__ings; *
there is none that doeth good, no not one.

3 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of __men__, *
to see if there were any that would understand, and __seek af__ter God.

4 But they are all gone out of the way,
  they are altogether become a__bo__minable; *
there is none that doeth good, __no__ not one.

5 Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of __mis__chief, *
eating up my people as it were bread, and call not u__pon__ the LORD ?

6 There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear __was__; *
for God is in the generation __of__ the righteous.

7 As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the __poor__; *
because he putteth his __trust in__ the LORD .

8 Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of __Si__on? *
When the LORD turneth the captivity of his people,
  then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel __shall__ be glad.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world without __end__. Amen.
