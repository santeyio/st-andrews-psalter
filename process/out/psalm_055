6

Hear my prayer, __O__ God, *
and hide not thyself __from my__ petition.

2 Take heed unto me, __and__ hear me, *
how I mourn in __my prayer__, and am vexed;

3 The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on __so__ fast; *
for they are minded to do me some mischief,
  so maliciously are __they set__ against me.

4 My heart is disquieted __with__in me, *
and the fear of death __is fallen__ upon me.

5 Fearfulness and trembling are come __up__on me, *
and an horrible dread __hath ov__erwhelmed me.

6 And I said, O that I had wings like __a __dove! *
for then would I flee __away__, and be at rest.

7 Lo, then would I get me away __far__ off, *
and __remain in__ the wilderness.

8 I would make haste to __es__cape, *
because of the stor__my wind__ and tempest.

9 Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and __div__ide them; *
for I have spied unrighteousness __and strife in__ the city.

10 Day and night they go about within the walls __there__of: *
mischief also and sorrow __are in__ the midst of it.

11 Wickedness is __there__in; *
deceit and guile go __not out__ of her streets.

12 For it is not an open enemy that hath done me this __dis__honour; *
for then __I could__ have borne it;

13 Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself __a__gainst
me; *
for then peradventure I would __have hid my__self from him;

14 But it was even thou, my __com__panion, *
my guide, and __mine own__ familiar friend.

15 We took sweet counsel __to__gether, *
and walked in __the house__ of God as friends.

16 Let death come hastily upon them,
  and let them go down alive into __the__ pit; *
for wickedness is in their dwell__ings, and__ among them.

17 As for me, I will call up__on__ God, *
and __the LORD__ shall save me.

18 In the evening, and morning, and at noon-day will I pray, and
__that__ instantly; *
__and he__ shall hear my voice.

19 It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that
was __a__gainst me; *
for there __were many__ that strove with me.

20 Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring
__them__ down; *
for they will __not turn__, nor fear God.

21 He laid his hands upon such as be __at__ peace with him, *
and __he brake__ his covenant.

22 The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in __his__ heart; *
his words were smoother than oil, __and yet be__ they very swords.

23 O cast thy burden upon the LORD , and he __shall__ nourish thee, *
and shall not suffer the righteous __to fall__ for ever.

24 And as __for__ them, *
thou, O God, shalt bring them into __the pit of__ destruction.

25 The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half __their__ days: *
nevertheless, my trust __shall be__ in thee, O Lord.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Ho__ly__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
