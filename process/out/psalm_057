5b

Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me;
  for my soul trusteth in __thee__; *
and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge,
  until this __tyranny__ be overpast.

2 I will call unto the Most High __God__, *
even unto the God that shall perform the cause __which__ I have in hand.

3 He shall send from __heav__en, *
and save me from the reproof of him __that__ would eat me up.

4 God shall send forth his mercy and __truth__: *
my soul __is a__mong lions;

5 And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on __fire__, *
whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their __tongue__ a sharp sword.

6 Set up thyself, O God, above the __hea__vens; *
and thy glory ab__ove__ all the earth.

7 They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my __soul__; *
they have digged a pit before me,
  and are fallen into the __midst__ of it themselves.

8 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is __fixed__; *
I will __sing__ and give praise.

9 Awake up, my glory;
  awake, lute and __harp__: *
I myself will aw__ake__ right early.

10 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the __peo__ples; *
and I will sing unto thee am__ong__ the nations.

11 For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the __hea__vens, *
and thy __truth__ unto the clouds.

12 Set up thyself, O God, above the __hea__vens; *
and thy glory ab__ove__ all the earth.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world __with__out end. Amen.
