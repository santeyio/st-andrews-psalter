4

Have mercy upon me, O God, after __thy great__ goodness; *
according to the multitude of thy mercies do __away mine__ offences.

2 Wash me throughly __from my__ wickedness, *
__and cleanse__ me from my sin.

3 For I ac__knowledge my__ faults, *
and my sin __is ever__ before me.

4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil __in thy__ sight; *
that thou mightest be justified in thy saying,
  __and clear__ when thou shalt judge.

5 Behold, I was __shapen in__ wickedness, *
and in sin hath __my mother__ conceived me.

6 But lo, thou requirest truth in the __inward__ parts, *
and shalt make me to under__stand wis__dom secretly.

7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and __I shall be__ clean; *
thou shalt wash me, and I shall __be whit__er than snow.

8 Thou shalt make me hear of __joy and__ gladness, *
that the bones which thou __hast bro__ken may rejoice.

9 Turn thy face __from my__ sins, *
and put __out all__ my misdeeds.

10 Make me a clean __heart, O__ God, *
and renew a __right spirit__ within me.

11 Cast me not away __from thy__ presence, *
and take not thy ho__ly Spi__rit from me.

12 O give me the comfort of thy __help a__gain, *
and stablish me __with thy__ free Spirit.

13 Then shall I teach thy ways un__to the__ wicked, *
and sinners shall be __convert__ed unto thee.

14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God,
  thou that art the God __of my__ health; *
and my tongue __shall sing of__ thy righteousness.

15 Thou shalt open my __lips, O__ Lord, *
and __my mouth__ shall show thy praise.

16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, else __would I__ give it thee; *
but thou delightest __not in__ burnt-offerings.

17 The sacrifice of God is a __troubled__ spirit: *
a broken and contrite heart, __O God, shalt__ thou not despise.

18 O be favourable and gracious __unto__ Sion; *
build thou __the walls of__ Jerusalem.

19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness,
  with the burnt-offerings __and ob__lations; *
then shall they offer young bullocks __upon__ thine altar.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
