8

Hear my law, O my __peo__ple; *
incline your ears unto the __words__ of my mouth.

2 I will open my mouth in a __pa__rable; *
I will declare hard __sen__tences of old;

3 Which we have heard and __known__, *
and such as our __fathers__ have told us;

4 That we should not hide them from the children of the generations
to __come__; *
but to show the honour of the LORD ,
  his mighty and wonderful __works__ that he hath done.

5 He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a __law__, *
which he commanded our forefathers to __teach__ their children;

6 That their posterity might __know__ it, *
and the children __which__ were yet unborn;

7 To the intent that when they came __up__, *
they might show their __chil__dren the same;

8 That they might put their trust in __God__; *
and not to forget the works of God, but to __keep his__ commandments;

9 And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn
gene__ra__tion; *
a generation that set not their heart aright,
  and whose spirit clave not __stedfast__ly unto God;

10 Like as the children of __Eph__raim; *
who being harnessed, and carrying bows, turned themselves back in
the __day__ of battle.

11 They kept not the covenant of __God__, *
and would not __walk__ in his law;

12 But forgat what he had __done__, *
and the wonderful works that __he__ had showed for them.

13 Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the
land of __Eg__ypt, *
even in the __field__ of Zoan.

14 He divided the sea, and let them go __through__; *
he made the waters to __stand__ on an heap.

15 In the day-time also he led them with a __cloud__, *
and all the night through __with__ a light of fire.

16 He clave the hard rocks in the __wil__derness, *
and gave them drink thereof, as it had been __out of__ the great depth.

17 He brought waters out of the stony __rock__, *
so that it gushed out __like__ the rivers.

18 Yet for all this they sinned more a__gainst__ him, *
and provoked the Most Highest __in__ the wilderness.

19 They tempted God in their __hearts__, *
and required __meat__ for their lust.

20 They spake against God also, __say__ing, *
Shall God prepare a table __in__ the wilderness?

21 He smote the stony rock indeed,
  that the water gushed out, and the streams __flowed__ withal; *
but can he give bread also, or provide __flesh for__ his people?

22 When the LORD heard this, he was __wroth__; *
so the fire was kindled in Jacob,
  and there came up heavy dis__pleasure a__gainst Israel;

23 Because they believed not in __God__, *
and put not their __trust__ in his help.

24 So he commanded the clouds ab__ove__, *
and opened the __doors__ of heaven.

25 He rained down manna also upon them for to __eat__, *
and gave them __food__ from heaven.

26 So man did eat angels' __food__; *
for he __sent__ them meat enough.

27 He caused the east-wind to blow under __hea__ven; *
and through his power he __brought in__ the southwest-wind.

28 He rained flesh upon them as thick as __dust__, *
and feathered fowls like as the __sand__ of the sea.

29 He let it fall among their __tents__, *
even round about their __ha__bitation.

30 So they did eat, and were well filled;
  for he gave them their own de__sire__: *
they were not disap__point__ed of their lust.

31 But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of
God came upon them,
  and slew the __wealth__iest of them; *
yea, and smote down the chosen men that __were__ in Israel.

32 But for all this they __sinned yet__ more, *
and __believed not__ his wondrous works.

33 Therefore their days did he con__sume in__ vanity, *
and __their years__ in trouble.

34 When he slew __them, they__ sought him, *
and turned them early, and __inquired__ after God.

35 And they remembered that God __was their__ strength, *
and that the High God __was their__ redeemer.

36 Nevertheless, they did but flatter him __with their__ mouth, *
and dissembled __with him__ in their tongue.

37 For their heart __was not__ whole with him, *
neither continued they sted__fast in__ his covenant.

38 But he was so merciful, that he forgave __their mis__deeds, *
__and de__stroyed them not.

39 Yea, many a time turned __he his__ wrath away, *
and would not suffer his whole __displea__sure to arise.

40 For he considered that __they were but__ flesh, *
and that they were even a wind that passeth away,
  __and com__eth not again.

41 Many a time did they provoke him __in the __wilderness, *
and grieved __him in__ the desert.

42 They turned back, and __tempted__ God, *
and provoked the Ho__ly One__ in Israel.

43 They thought not __of his__ hand, *
and of the day when he delivered them from __the hand of__ the enemy;

44 How he had wrought his mira__cles in__ Egypt, *
and his wonders in __the field__ of Zoan.

45 He turned their waters __into__ blood, *
so that they might __not drink of__ the rivers.

46 He sent flies among them, and de__voured them__ up; *
__and frogs to__ destroy them.

47 He gave their fruit un__to the__ caterpillar, *
and their lab__our unto__ the grasshopper.

48 He destroyed their __vines with__ hailstones, *
and __their mulberry__-trees with the frost.

49 He smote their cattle __also with__ hailstones, *
and __their flocks with__ hot thunderbolts.

50 He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger,
dis__pleasure, and__ trouble: *
and sent e__vil angels__ among them.

51 He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their __soul from__
death; *
but gave their life ov__er to__ the pestilence;

52 And smote all the __firstborn in__ Egypt, *
the most principal and mightiest in __the dwell__ings of Ham.

53 But as for his own people, he led them __forth like__ sheep, *
and carried them in __the wilder__ness like a flock.

54 He brought them out safely, that __they should not__ fear, *
and overwhelmed __their enem__ies with the sea.

55 And brought them within the borders __of his__ sanctuary, *
even to this mountain, which he pur__chased with__ his right hand.

56 He cast out the heathen __also be__fore them, *
caused their land to be divided among them for an heritage,
  and made the tribes of Israel __to dwell__ in their tents.

57 Yet they tempted and displeased the Most High __God__, *
and __kept not__ his testimonies.

58 They turned their backs, and fell away like their __fore__fathers; *
starting aside __like__ a broken bow.

59 For they grieved him with their hill-__al__tars, *
and provoked him to displeasure __with__ their images.

60 When God heard this, he was __wroth__, *
and took sore dis__pleasure__ at Israel;

61 So that he forsook the tabernacle in __Shi__loh, *
even the tent that he had __pitched__ among men.

62 He delivered their power into cap__ti__vity, *
and their beauty into the __en__emy's hand.

63 He gave his people over also unto the __sword__, *
and was wroth with __his__ inheritance.

64 The fire consumed their young __men__, *
and their maidens were not __given__ in marriage.

65 Their priests were slain with the __sword__, *
and there were no widows to __make la__mentation.

66 So the Lord awaked as one out of __sleep__, *
and like a __giant__ refreshed with wine.

67 He drave his enemies __back__ward, *
and put them to a per__pe__tual shame.

68 He refused the tabernacle of __Jo__seph, *
and chose not the __tribe__ of Ephraim;

69 But chose the tribe of __Ju__dah, *
even the hill of __Si__on which he loved.

70 And there he built his temple on __high__, *
and laid the foundation of it like the ground which he hath __made__
continually.

71 He chose David also his __ser__vant, *
and took him away __from__ the sheep-folds:

72 As he was following the ewes with their young he __took__ him, *
that he might feed Jacob his people, and Israel __his__ inheritance.

73 So he fed them with a faithful and true __heart__, *
and ruled them prudently with __all__ his power.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
