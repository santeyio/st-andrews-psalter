4

Put me not to rebuke, O LORD , __in thine__ anger; *
neither chasten me in __thy heavy__ displeasure:

2 For thine __arrows stick__ fast in me, *
and thy __hand press__eth me sore.

3 There is no health in my flesh, because of __thy dis__pleasure; *
neither is there any rest in my bones, __by rea__son of my sin.

4 For my wickednesses are gone __over my__ head, *
and are like a sore burden, __too heavy__ for me to bear.

5 My wounds stink, and __are cor__rupt, *
__through my__ foolishness.

6 I am brought into so great __trouble and__ misery, *
that I go mourn__ing all__ the day long.

7 For my loins are filled with a __sore dis__ease, *
and there is no __whole part in__ my body.

8 I am feeble __and sore__ smitten; *
I have roared for the very __disquiet__ness of my heart.

9 Lord, thou knowest __all my de__sire; *
and my groan__ing is__ not hid from thee.

10 My heart panteth, my __strength hath__ failed me, *
and the light of __mine eyes__ is gone from me.

11 My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking up__on my__ trouble,
* and my kins__men stood__ afar off.

12 They also that sought after my __life laid__ snares for me; *
and they that went about to do me evil talked of wickedness,
  and imagined __deceit all__ the day long.

13 As for me, I was like a deaf __man, and__ heard not; *
and as one that is dumb, who doth __not op__en his mouth.

14 I became even as a man that __heareth__ not, *
and in __whose mouth__ are no reproofs.

15 For in thee, O LORD , have I __put my__ trust; *
thou shalt answer __for me__, O Lord my God.

16 I have required that they, even mine enemies, should not __triumph__
over me; *
for when my foot slipt, they rej__oiced greatly__ against me.

17 And I truly am set __in the__ plague, *
and my heaviness __is ev__er in my sight.

18 For I will con__fess my__ wickedness, *
and __be sor__ry for my sin.

19 But mine enemies live, __and are__ mighty; *
and they that hate me wrongfully __are many__ in number.

20 They also that reward evil for good __are a__gainst me; *
because I follow __the thing__ that good is.

21 Forsake me not, O __LORD my__ God; *
__be not__ thou far from me.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
