4

The LORD , even the Most Mighty __God, hath__ spoken, *
and called the world, from the rising up of the sun unto __the go__ing
down thereof.

2 Out of Sion hath __God ap__peared *
__in per__fect beauty.

3 Our God shall come, and shall __not keep__ silence; *
there shall go before him a consuming fire,
  and a mighty tempest shall be stirred __up round__ about him.

4 He shall call the heaven __from a__bove, *
and the earth, that he __may judge__ his people.

5 Gather my saints together __unto__ me; *
those that have made a covenant __with me__ with sacrifice.

6 And the heavens shall de__clare his__ righteousness; *
__for God__ is Judge himself.

7 Hear, O my people, and __I will__ speak; *
I myself will testify against thee, O Israel;
  for I __am God, ev__en thy God.

8 I will not reprove thee be__cause of thy__ sacrifices; *
as for thy burnt-offerings, they __are alway__ before me.

9 I will take no bullock __out of thine__ house, *
nor he-__goats out__ of thy folds.

10 For all the beasts of the __forest are__ mine, *
and so are the cattle __upon__ a thousand hills.

11 I know all the fowls up__on the__ mountains, *
and the wild beasts of __the field__ are in my sight.

12 If I be hungry, I __will not__ tell thee; *
for the whole world is mine, __and all__ that is therein.

13 Thinkest thou that I will __eat bulls__' flesh, *
__and drink__ the blood of goats?

14 Offer unto __God thanks__giving, *
and pay thy vows __unto the__ Most Highest.

15 And call upon me in the __time of__ trouble; *
so will I hear thee, __and thou__ shalt praise me.

16 But unto the un__godly saith__ God, *
Why dost thou preach my laws, and takest __my cove__nant in thy
mouth;

17 Whereas thou hatest to __be re__formed, *
and hast cast __my words__ behind thee?

18 When thou sawest a thief, thou con__sentedst__ unto him; *
and hast been partak__er with the__ adulterers.

19 Thou hast let thy __mouth speak__ wickedness, *
and with thy tongue __thou hast__ set forth deceit.

20 Thou sattest and spakest ag__ainst thy__ brother; *
yea, and hast slan__dered thine__ own mother's son.

21 These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue,
  and thou thoughtest wickedly, that I am even such a one __as thy__self;
* but I will reprove thee, and set before thee __the things__ that thou
hast done.

22 O consider this, __ye that for__get God, *
lest I pluck you away, and there __be none to__ deliver you.

23 Whoso offereth me thanks and __praise, he__ honoureth me; *
and to him that ordereth his way aright, will I show the __salva__tion of
God.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
