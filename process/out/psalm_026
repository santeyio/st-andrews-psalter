Be thou my Judge, O LORD ,

2 Examine me, O __LORD , and__ prove me; *
try out __my reins__ and my heart.

3 For thy loving-kindness is ever be__fore mine__ eyes; *
and I __will walk__ in thy truth.

4 I have not dwelt __with vain__ persons; *
neither will I have fellowship __with the__ deceitful.

5 I have hated the congregation __of the__ wicked; *
and will not sit __among the__ ungodly.

6 I will wash my hands in innocen__cy, O__ LORD ; *
and so will __I go to__ thine altar;

7 That I may show the voice __of thanks__giving, *
and tell __of all__ thy wondrous works.

8 LORD , I have loved the habitation __of thy__ house, *
and the place where __thine hon__our dwelleth.

9 O shut not up my soul __with the__ sinners, *
nor __my life with__ the blood-thirsty;

10 In whose __hands is__ wickedness, *
and their __right hand__ is full of gifts.

11 But as for me, I __will walk__ innocently: *
O deliver me, and __be merciful__ unto me.

12 My foot __standeth__ right: *
I will praise the LORD in __the cong__regations.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
