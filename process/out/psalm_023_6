6

THE LORD is __my__ shepherd; *
therefore __can I__ lack nothing.

2 He shall feed me in a __green__ pasture, *
and lead me forth beside __the waters__ of comfort.

3 He shall convert __my__ soul, *
and bring me forth in the paths of righteous__ness for__ his Name's sake.

4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
  I will fear __no__ evil; *
for thou art with me;
  thy rod __and thy staff__ comfort me.

5 Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of them __that__
trouble me; *
  thou hast anointed my head with oil,
  and __my cup__ shall be full.

6 Surely thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days
of __my__ life; *
and I will dwell in the house of __the LORD__ for ever.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Ho__ly__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
