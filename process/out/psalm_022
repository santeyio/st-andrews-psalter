2

My God, my God, look upon me; why hast thou for__sak__en me? *
and art so far from my health, and from the words of __my__ complaint?

2 O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest __not__; *
and in the night season also I __take__ no rest.

3 And thou continuest __ho__ly, *
O thou __Worship__ of Israel.

4 Our fathers hoped in __thee__; *
they trusted in thee, and thou __didst__ deliver them.

5 They called upon thee, and were __hol__pen; *
they put their trust in thee, and were __not__ confounded.

6 But as for me, I am a worm, and no __man__; *
a very scorn of men, and the outcast __of__ the people.

7 All they that see me laugh me to __scorn__; *
they shoot out their lips, and __shake their__ heads, saying,

8 He trusted in the LORD , that he would de__liv__er him; *
let him deliver him, if __he__ will have him.

9 But thou art he that took me out of my mother's __womb__; *
thou wast my hope, when I hanged yet upon my __mo__ther's breasts.

10 I have been left unto thee ever since I was __born__; *
thou art my God even from my __mo__ther's womb.

11 O go not from me; for trouble is hard at __hand__, *
and there is __none__ to help me.

12 Many oxen are come ab__out__ me; *
fat bulls of Bashan close me in on __ev__ery side.

13 They gape upon me with their __mouths__, *
as it were a ramping and a __roar__ing lion.

14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of __joint__; *
my heart also in the midst of my body is even like __melt__ing wax.

15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd,
  and my tongue cleaveth to my __gums__, *
and thou bringest me into the __dust__ of death.

16 For many dogs are come ab__out__ me, *
and the council of the wicked layeth __siege__ against me.

17 They pierced my hands and my feet:
  I may tell all my __bones__: *
they stand staring and __looking__ upon me.

18 They part my garments am__ong__ them, *
and cast lots up__on__ my vesture.

19 But be not thou far from me, O __LORD__ ; *
thou art my succour, __haste thee__ to help me.

20 Deliver my soul from the __sword__, *
my darling from the power __of__ the dog.

21 Save me from the lion's __mouth__; *
thou hast heard me also from among the __horns of__ the unicorns.

22 I will declare thy Name unto __my__ brethren; *
in the midst of the congrega__tion will__ I praise thee.

23 O praise the LORD , ye __that__ fear him: *
magnify him, all ye of the seed of Jacob;
  and fear him, all __ye seed__ of Israel.

24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the low estate of __the__ poor; * 
he hath not hid his face from him;
  but when he called un__to him__ he heard him.

25 My praise is of thee in the great con__greg__ation; *
my vows will I perform in the sight __of them__ that fear him.

26 The poor shall eat, and be satisfied;
  they that seek after the LORD __shal__l praise him: *
your heart __shall live__ for ever.

27 All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be
turned unto __the__ LORD ; *
and all the kindreds of the nations __shall worship__ before him.

28 For the kingdom is __the__ LORD'S, *
and he is the Governor __among__ the nations.

29 All such as be fat up__on__ earth *
__have eaten__, and worshipped.

30 All they that go down into the dust shall kneel __be__fore him; *
and no man __hath quickened__ his own soul.

31 My seed __shall__ serve him: *
they shall be counted unto the Lord for __a ge__neration.

32 They shall come, and shall declare __his__ righteousness *
unto a people that shall __be born, whom__ the Lord hath made.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Ho__ly__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
