We have heard with our ears, O God,
  our fathers have __told__ us *
what thou hast done in their __time__ of old:

2 How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand,
  and planted our fathers __in__; *
how thou hast destroyed the nations,
  and made thy __people__ to flourish.

3 For they gat not the land in possession through their own __sword__, *
neither was it their own __arm__ that helped them;

4 But thy right hand, and thine arm,
  and the light of thy __coun__tenance; *
because thou hadst a favour __un__to them.

5 Thou art my __King__, O God; *
send __help un__to Jacob.

6 Through thee will we overthrow our __en__emies, *
and in thy Name will we tread them under that __rise up__ against us.

7 For I will not trust in my __bow__, *
it is not my __sword that__ shall help me;

8 But it is thou that savest us from our __en__emies, *
and puttest them to con__fusion__ that hate us.

9 We make our boast of God all day __long__, *
and will praise thy __Name__ for ever.

10 But now thou art far off, and puttest us to con__fu__sion, *
and goest not forth __with__ our armies.

11 Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our __en__emies, *
so that they which hate us __spoil__ our goods.

12 Thou lettest us be eaten up like __sheep__, *
and hast scattered us a__mong__ the heathen.

13 Thou sellest thy people for __nought__, *
and takest no __mo__ney for them.

14 Thou makest us to be rebuked of our __neigh__bours, *
to be laughed to scorn,
  and had in derision of them that are __round__ about us.

15 Thou makest us to be a by-word among the __na__tions, *
and that the peoples __shake__ their heads at us.

16 My confusion is daily be__fore__ me, *
and the shame of my __face__ hath covered me;

17 For the voice of the slanderer and __blas__phemer, *
for the enemy __and__ avenger.

18 And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not for__get__ thee, *
nor behave ourselves frowardly __in__ thy covenant.

19 Our heart is not turned __back__, *
neither our steps gone __out of__ thy way;

20 No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of __dra__gons, *
and covered us with the __shadow__ of death.

21 If we have forgotten the Name of our God,
  and holden up our hands to any strange __god__, *
shall not God search it out?
  for he knoweth the very secrets __of__ the heart.

22 For thy sake also are we killed all the day __long__, *
and are counted as sheep appointed __to__ be slain.

23 Up, Lord, why __sleep__est thou? *
awake, and be not absent from __us__ for ever.

24 Wherefore hidest thou thy __face__, *
and forgettest our __misery__ and trouble?

25 For our soul is brought low, even unto the __dust__; *
our belly cleaveth __unto__ the ground.

26 Arise, and __help__ us, *
and deliver us, for thy __mer__cy's sake.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world without __end__. Amen.
