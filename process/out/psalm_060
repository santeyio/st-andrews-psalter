heal the sores __thereof, for__ it shaketh.

3 Thou hast showed thy people __heavy__ things; *
thou hast given us __a drink__ of deadly wine.

4 Thou hast given a token for __such as__ fear thee, *
that they may triumph __because__ of the truth.

5 Therefore were thy be__loved de__livered; *
help me with thy __right hand__, and hear me.

6 God hath spoken in his holiness,
  I will rejoice, __and divide__ Shechem, *
and mete out __the valley__ of Succoth.

7 Gilead is mine, and Ma__nasseh is__ mine; *
Ephraim also is the strength of my head;
  Ju__dah is__ my law-giver;

8 Moab is my wash-pot;
  over Edom will I __cast out my__ shoe; *
Philis__tia, be__ thou glad of me.

9 Who will lead me in__to the strong__ city? *
who will bring __me into__ Edom?

10 Hast not thou cast us __out, O__ God? *
wilt not thou, O God, __go out__ with our hosts?

11 O be thou our __help in__ trouble; *
__for vain is__ the help of man.

12 Through God will we __do great__ acts; *
for it is he that __shall tread down__ our enemies.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
