Ponder my words, O __LORD__ , *
consider my __med__itation.

2 O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my
God: * for unto thee will I __make__ my prayer.

3 My voice shalt thou hear be__times__, O LORD ; *
early in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee,
  and __will__ look up.

4 For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in __wic__kedness; *
neither shall any evil __dwell__ with thee.

5 Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy __sight__; *
for thou hatest all them that __work__ iniquity.

6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak __lies__: *
the LORD will abhor both the blood-thirsty and de__ceit__ful man.

7 But as for me, in the multitude of thy mercy I will come into thine __house__; *
  and in thy fear will I worship toward thy __ho__ly temple.

8 Lead me, O LORD , in thy righteousness, because of mine __en__emies; *
make thy way plain be__fore__ my face.

9 For there is no faithfulness in their __mouth__; *
their inward parts are __ve__ry wickedness.

10 Their throat is an open __sep__ulchre; *
they flatter __with__ their tongue.

11 Destroy thou them, O God;
  let them perish through their own imagi__na__tions; *
cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness;
  for they have re__belled__ against thee.

12 And let all them that put their trust in thee rej__oice__: *
they shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them;
  they that love thy Name shall be __joyful__ in thee;

13 For thou, LORD , wilt give thy blessing unto the __right__eous, *
and with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defend him as __with__ a shield.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world without __end__. Amen.
