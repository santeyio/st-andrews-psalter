2

The LORD is my light and my salvation;
  whom then shall I __fear__? *
the LORD is the strength of my life;
  of whom then shall I __be__ afraid?

2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes,
  came upon me to eat up my __flesh__, *
they __stumbled__ and fell.

3 Though an host of men were laid against me,
  yet shall not my heart be af__raid__; *
and though there rose up war against me,
  yet will I put my __trust__ in him.

4 One thing have I desired of the LORD , which I will re__quire__; *
even that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my
life,
  to behold the fair beauty of the LORD ,
  and to __visit__ his temple.

5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his __ta__bernacle; *
yea, in the secret place of his dwelling shall he hide me,
  and set me up upon a __rock__ of stone.

6 And now shall he lift up mine __head__ *
above mine enemies __round__ about me.

7 Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation, with great
__glad__ness: *
I will sing and speak praises __unto__ the LORD .

8 Hearken unto my voice, O LORD , when I cry unto __thee__; *
have mercy up__on me__, and hear me.

9 My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my __face__: *
Thy face, LORD , __will__ I seek.

10 O hide not thou thy __face__ from me, *
nor cast thy servant away __in__ displeasure.

11 Thou hast been my __su__ccour; *
leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of __my__ salvation.

12 When my father and my mother for__sake__ me, *
the LORD __taketh__ me up.

13 Teach me thy way, O __LORD__ , *
and lead me in the right way, be__cause of__ mine enemies.

14 Deliver me not over into the will of mine __ad__versaries: *
for there are false witnesses risen up against me,
  and __such as__ speak wrong.

15 I should utterly have __fain__ted, *
but that I believe verily to see the goodness of the LORD in the __land__
__of__ the living.

16 O tarry thou the LORD ' S __lei__sure; *
be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart;
  and put thou thy __trust in__ the LORD .

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world without __end__. Amen.
