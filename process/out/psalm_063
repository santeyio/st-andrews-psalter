4

O God, thou __art my__ God; *
ear__ly will__ I seek thee.

2 My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also __longeth__ after thee, *
in a barren and dry __land where__ no water is.

3 Thus have I looked for thee __in the__ sanctuary, *
that I might behold __thy power__ and glory.

4 For thy loving-kindness is better than __life it__self: *
__my lips__ shall praise thee.

5 As long as I live will I magnify thee __in this__ manner, *
and lift up __my hands__ in thy Name.

6 My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with __marrow and__ fatness,
* when my mouth prais__eth thee__ with joyful lips.

7 Have I not remembered thee __in my__ bed, *
and thought upon thee __when I__ was waking?

8 Because thou hast __been my__ helper; *
therefore under the shadow of __thy wings__ will I rejoice.

9 My soul __hangeth up__on thee; *
thy __right hand hath__ upholden me.

10 These also that seek the __hurt of my__ soul, *
__they shall__ go under the earth.

11 Let them fall upon the __edge of the__ sword, *
that they may be __a portion__ for foxes.

12 But the King shall rejoice in God;
  all they also that swear by him shall __be com__mended; *
for the mouth of them __that speak__ lies shall be stopped.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
