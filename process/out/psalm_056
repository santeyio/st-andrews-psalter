5

Be merciful unto me, O God, for man goeth about to dev__our__ me; *
he is daily __fighting, and__ troubling me.

2 Mine enemies are daily at hand to swallow me __up__; *
for they be many that fight against me, O __thou Most__ Highest.

3 Nevertheless, though I am sometime af__raid__, *
yet __put I my__ trust in thee.

4 I will praise God, because of his __word__: *
I have put my trust in God,
  and will not fear what __flesh__ can do unto me.

5 They daily mistake my __words__; *
all that they imagine is to __do me__ evil.

6 They hold all together, and keep themselves __close__, *
and mark my steps, when they lay __wait for__ my soul.

7 Shall they escape for their __wi__ckedness? *
thou, O God, in thy displeasure __shalt cast__ them down.

8 Thou tellest my wanderings;
  put my tears into thy __bot__tle: *
are not these things __noted__ in thy book?

9 Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to
__flight__: *
this I know; for __God is__ on my side.

10 In God's word will I re__joice__; *
in the LORD ' S word __will I__ comfort me.

11 Yea, in God have I put my __trust__; *
I will not be afraid what __man can__ do unto me.

12 Unto thee, O God, will I pay my __vows__; *
unto thee __will I__ give thanks.

13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from
__fal__ling, *
that I may walk before God in the __light of the__ living.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world without__ end. Amen.
