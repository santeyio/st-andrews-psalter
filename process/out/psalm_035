2

Plead thou my cause, O LORD , with them that __strive__ with me, *
and fight thou against them that __fight__ against me.

2 Lay hand upon the shield and __buck__ler, *
and stand __up__ to help me.

3 Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that pur__sue__
me: *
say unto my soul, I am __thy__ salvation.

4 Let them be confounded, and put to shame, that seek after my
__soul__; *
let them be turned back, and brought to confusion, that imagine
__mischief__ for me.

5 Let them be as the dust before the __wind__, *
and the angel __of the__ LORD scattering them.

6 Let their way be dark and __slip__pery, *
and let the angel of the __LORD__ pursue them.

7 For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a __cause__;
* yea, even without a cause have they made a __pit for__ my soul.

8 Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares,
  and his net that he hath laid privily catch him__self__; *
that he may fall into __his__ own mischief.

9 And my soul shall be joyful in the __LORD__ ; *
it shall rejoice in __his__ salvation.

10 All my bones shall say, LORD , who is like unto thee,
who deliverest the poor from him that is too __strong__ for him; *
yea, the poor, and him that is in misery, from __him__ that spoileth him?

11 False witnesses did rise __up__: *
they laid to my charge things that __I__ knew not.

12 They rewarded me evil for __good__, *
to the great discomfort __of__ my soul.

13 Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth,
and humbled my soul with __fast__ing; *
and my prayer shall turn into __mine__ own bosom.

14 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my __bro__ther;
* I went heavily, as one that mourneth __for__ his mother.

15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced,
  and gathered themselves to__ge__ther; *
yea, the very abjects came together against me unawares,
  making mouths at me, __and__ ceased not.

16 With the flatterers were busy __mock__ers, *
who gnashed upon me __with__ their teeth.

17 Lord, how long wilt thou look up__on__ this? *
O deliver my soul from the calamities which they bring on me,
  and my darling __from__ the lions.

18 So will I give thee thanks in the great congre__ga__tion; *
I will praise thee a__mong__ much people.

19 O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me un__godly__;
* neither let them wink with their eyes, that hate me with__out__ a
cause.

20 And why? their communing is not for __peace__; *
but they imagine deceitful words against them that are quiet __in__ the
land.

21 They gaped upon me with their mouths, and __said__, *
Fie on thee! fie on thee!
  we saw it __with__ our eyes.

22 This thou hast seen, O __LORD__ ; *
hold not thy tongue then; go not far from __me__, O Lord.

23 Awake, and stand up to judge my __qua__rrel; *
avenge thou my cause, my __God and__ my Lord.

24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy __right__eousness; *
and let them not triumph __ov__er me.

25 Let them not say in their hearts, There! there! so would we __have__
it; *
neither let them say, __We have__ devoured him.

26 Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice at
my __trou__ble; *
let them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that boast
them__selves__ against me.

27 Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous __deal__ing; *
yea, let them say alway, Bless√®d be the LORD ,
  who hath pleasure in the prosperity __of__ his servant.

28 And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy __right__eousness, *
and of thy praise, __all the__ day long.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world without __end__. Amen.
