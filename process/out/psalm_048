7

Great is the LORD , and __highly__ to be praised *
in the city of our God, even up__on his__ holy hill.

2 The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the __joy of the__ whole earth; *
upon the north side lieth the city of the great King:
  God is well known in her palaces __as a sure__ refuge.

3 For lo, the __kings of__ the earth *
were gathered, and gone __by to__gether.

4 They __marvelled to__ see such things; *
they were astonished, and __suddenly__ cast down.

5 Fear came there up__on them; and__ sorrow, *
as upon a woman __in her__ travail.

6 Thou dost break the __ships of__ the sea *
__through the__ east-wind.

7 Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
hosts,
  in the __city__ of our God; *
God upholdeth the __same for__ ever.

8 We wait for thy loving-__kindness__, O God, *
in the __midst of thy__ temple.

9 O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise __unto the__ world's
end; *
thy right hand is __full of__ righteousness.

10 Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of __Judah__ be glad, *
be__cause of thy__ judgments.

11 Walk about Sion, and go __round a__bout her; *
and tell the __towers__ thereof.

12 Mark well her bulwarks, con__sider her__ palaces, *
that ye may tell __them that come__ after.

13 For this God is our God for __ever and__ ever: *
he shall be our __guide un__to death.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world without__ end. Amen.
