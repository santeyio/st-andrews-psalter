8

How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD ; for __ev__er? *
how long wilt thou __hide__ thy face from me?

2 How long shall I seek counsel in my soul,
  and be so vexed in my __heart__? *
how long shall mine enemy __tri__umph over me?

3 Consider, and hear me, O LORD my __God__; *
lighten mine eyes, that I __sleep__ not in death;

4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed a__gainst__ him: *
for if I be cast down, they that trouble me __will__ rejoice at it.

5 But my trust is in thy __mer__cy, *
and my heart is joyful in __thy__ salvation.

6 I will sing of the LORD , because he hath dealt so lovingly with __me__;
* yea, I will praise the Name of the __Lord__ Most Highest.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
