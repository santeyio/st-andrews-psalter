7

I will cry unto __God with__ my voice; *
even unto God will I cry with my voice,
  and he shall __hearken__ unto me.

2 In the time of my __trouble I__ sought the Lord: *
I stretched forth my hands unto him,
  and ceased not in the night season; my __soul refused__ comfort.

3 When I am in heaviness, I will __think up__on God; *
when my heart is __vexed, I__ will complain.

4 Thou __holdest mine__ eyes waking: *
I am so feeble that __I can__not speak.

5 I have con__sidered the__ days of old, *
and the __years that__ are past.

6 I call to re__membrance__ my song, *
and in the night I commune with mine own heart,
  and __search out my__ spirit.

7 Will the Lord abs√©nt him__self for__ ever? *
and will he be no __more in__treated?

8 Is his mercy clean __gone for__ ever? *
and is his promise come utterly to an __end for__ evermore?

9 Hath God forgotten __to be__ gracious? *
and will he shut up his loving-kindness __in dis__pleasure?

10 And I said, It is mine __own in__firmity; *
but I will remember the years of the right hand __of the__ Most Highest.

11 I will remember the __works of__ the LORD , *
and call to mind thy __wonders of__ old time.

12 I will think __also of__ all thy works, *
and my talking shall __be of__ thy doings.

13 Thy way, O __God, is__ holy: *
who is so great a __God as__ our God?

14 Thou art the God that __doest__ wonders, *
and hast declared thy power am__ong the__ peoples.

15 Thou hast mightily de__livered thy__ people, *
even the sons of __Jacob and__ Joseph.

16 The waters saw thee, O God,
  the waters __saw thee, and__ were afraid; *
the depths __also__ were troubled.

17 The clouds poured out __water, the air__ thundered, *
and thine __arrows__ went abroad.

18 The voice of thy thunder was __heard round__ about: *
the lightnings shone upon the ground;
  the earth was __moved, and__ shook withal.

19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths __in the__ great waters, *
and thy __footsteps__ are not known.

20 Thou leddest thy __people__ like sheep, *
by the hand of __Moses__ and Aaron.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world without__ end. Amen.
