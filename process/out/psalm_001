2

Bless√®d is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly,
  nor stood in the way of __sin__ners, *
and hath not sat in the __seat of__ the scornful.

2 But his delight is in the law of the __LORD__ ; *
and in his law will he exercise himself __day__ and night.

3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the __wa__ter-side, *
that will bring forth his __fruit in__ due season.

4 His leaf also shall not __wi__ther; *
and look, whatsoever he doeth, __it__ shall prosper.

5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with __them__; *
but they are like the chaff,
  which the wind scattereth away from the __face of__ the earth.

6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the __jud__gment, *
neither the sinners in the congregation __of__ the righteous.

7 But the LORD knoweth the way of the __right__eous; *
and the way of the un__godly__ shall perish.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world without __end__. Amen.
