The LORD __is my__ shepherd; *
therefore|can I·lack|no-|thing.

2 He shall feed me __in a green__ pasture, *
and lead me forth beside the|waters·of|com-|fort.

3 He __shall con__vert my soul, *
and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness|for his|Name's|
sake.

4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
  I will __fear no__ evil; *
for thou art with me;
  thy rod and thy|staff|comfort|me.

5 Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of __them that__
trouble me; *
thou hast anointed my head with|oil,
  and my|cup shall|be full.

6 Surely thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the __days of__ my life; *
and I will dwell in the house of the|LORD for|ev-|er.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Hol__y Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world|without|end.|Amen.
