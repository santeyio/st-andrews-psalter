6

Fret not thyself because of the __un__godly; *
neither be thou envious against __the ev__il doers.

2 For they shall soon be cut down like __the__ grass, *
and be withered ev__en as__ the green herb.

3 Put thou thy trust in the LORD , and be do__ing__ good; *
dwell in the land, __and verily__ thou shalt be fed.

4 Delight thou in __the__ LORD , *
and he __shall give thee__ thy heart's desire.

5 Commit thy way unto the LORD , and put thy trust __in__ him, *
and he __shall bring__ it to pass.

6 He shall make thy righteousness as clear as __the__ light, *
and thy just dea__ling as__ the noon-day.

7 Hold thee still in the LORD , and abide patiently __up__on him: *
but grieve not thyself at him whose way doth prosper,
  against the man that doeth aft__er ev__il counsels.

8 Leave off from wrath, and let go __dis__pleasure: *
fret not thyself, else shalt thou __be moved to__ do evil.

9 Wicked doers shall be root__ed__ out; *
and they that patiently abide the LORD , those shall __inhe__rit the land.

10 Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be __clean__ gone: *
thou shalt look after his place, __and__ he shall be away.

11 But the meek-spirited shall possess __the__ earth, *
and shall be refreshed in __the mul__titude of peace.

12 The ungodly seeketh __counsel ag__ainst the just, *
and gnasheth up-|on him|with his|teeth.

13 The Lord shall __laugh him__ to scorn; *
for he hath seen that his|day is|com-|ing.

14 The ungodly have drawn out the __sword, and have__ bent their bow,
* to cast down the poor and needy,
  and to slay such as be|upright|in their|ways.

15 Their sword shall go __through their__ own heart, *
and their bow|shall be|bro-|ken.

16 A small thing __that the__ righteous hath, *
is better than great|riches|of the·un-|godly.

17 For the arms of the ungodly __shall be__ broken, *
and the|LORD up-|holdeth·the|righteous.

18 The LORD knoweth the __days of the__ godly; *
and their inheritance shall en-|dure for|ev-|er.

19 They shall not be confounded in the __peril__ous time; *
and in the days of dearth|they shall|have e-|nough.

20 As for the ungodly, they shall perish,
  and the enemies of the LORD shall con__sume as the__ fat of lambs: *
yea, even as the smoke shall|they con-|sume a-|way.

21 The ungodly borroweth, and __payeth__ not again; *
but the righteous is|merci-|ful and|liberal.

22 Such as are blessèd of God, __shall pos__sess the land; *
and they that are cursed of him,|shall be|rooted|out.

23 The LORD ordereth a __good man's__ going, *
and maketh his way accep__table__ to himself.

24 Though he fall, he shall not be __cast__ away; *
for the LORD __upholdeth__ him with his hand.

25 I have been young, and __now am__ old; *
and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken,
  nor his __seed beg__ging their bread.

26 The righteous is ever merci__ful, and__ lendeth; *
and __his__ seed is blessèd.

27 Flee from evil, and do the thing __that is__ good; *
and dwell for evermore.

28 For the LORD loveth the thing __that is__ right; *
he forsaketh not his that be godly,
  but they are __preserved__ for ever.

29 The unrighteous __shall be__ punished; *
as for the seed of the ungodly, __it shall__ be rooted out.

30 The righteous shall in__herit the__ land, *
and dwell __therein__ for ever.

31 The mouth of the righteous is exer__cised in__ wisdom, *
and his tongue will __be talking__ of judgment.

32 The law of his God is __in his__ heart, *
and __his go__ings shall not slide.

33 The ungodly __watcheth the__ righteous, *
and seeketh __occasion__ to slay him.

34 The LORD will not leave him __in his__ hand, *
nor __condemn him__ when he is judged.

35 Hope thou in the LORD , and keep his way,
and he shall promote thee, that thou shalt possess __the__ land: *
when the ungodly shall per__ish, thou__ shalt see it.

36 I myself have seen the ungodly in __great__ power, *
and flourish__ing like a__ green bay-tree.

37 I went by, and lo, he __was__ gone: *
I sought him, but his place __could no__where be found.

38 Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that __is__ right; *
for that shall bring a __man peace__ at the last.

39 As for the transgressors, they shall perish __to__gether; *
and the end of the ungodly is, they shall be root__ed out__ at the last.

40 But the salvation of the righteous cometh of __the__ LORD ; *
who is also their strength in __the time__ of trouble.

41 And the LORD shall stand by them, __and__ save them: *
he shall deliver them from the ungodly,
  and shall save them, because __they put__ their trust in him.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Ho__ly__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
