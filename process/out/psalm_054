8

Save me, O God, for thy __Name's__ sake, *
and av__enge__ me in thy strength.

2 Hear my __prayer__, O God, *
and hearken unto the __words__ of my mouth.

3 For strangers are risen up a__gainst__ me; *
and tyrants, which have not God before their eyes, seek __af__ter my
soul.

4 Behold, God is my __help__er; *
the Lord is with __them that__ uphold my soul.

5 He shall reward evil unto mine __en__emies: *
destroy thou __them__ in thy truth.

6 An offering of a free heart will I give thee,
  and praise thy __Name__, O LORD ; *
because it __is__ so comfortable.

7 For he hath delivered me out of all my __trou__ble; *
and mine eye hath seen his desire up__on__ mine enemies.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
