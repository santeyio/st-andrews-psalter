when __my heart is__ in heaviness.

3 O set me up upon the rock that is higher __than__ I; *

enemy.

4 I will dwell in thy tabernacle __for__ ever, *
and my trust shall be under __the cover__ing of thy wings.

5 For thou, O Lord, hast heard my __de__sires, *
and hast given an heritage un__to those__ that fear thy Name.

6 Thou shalt grant the King a __long__ life, *
that his years may endure throughout __all__ generations.

7 He shall dwell before God __for__ ever: *
O prepare thy loving mercy and faithfulness,
  __that they may__ preserve him.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Ho__ly__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
