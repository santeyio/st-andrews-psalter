O hear ye this, all ye __peo__ple; *
ponder it with your ears, all ye that __dwell in__ the world;

2 High and low, rich and __poor__, *
one __with__ another.

3 My mouth shall speak of __wis__dom, *
and my heart shall muse of __un__derstanding.

4 I will incline mine ear to the __pa__rable, *
and show my dark speech up__on__ the harp.

5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of __ev__il, *
when wickedness at my heels compasseth me __round__ about?

6 There be some that put their trust in their __goods__, *
and boast themselves in the multitude __of__ their riches.

7 But no man may deliver his __bro__ther, *
nor give a ransom unto __God__ for him,

8 (For it cost more to redeem their __souls__, *
so that he must let that al__one__ for ever;)

9 That he shall live __al__way, *
and not __see__ the grave.

10 For he seeth that wise men also die and perish to__get__her, *
as well as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their __riches__ for other.

11 And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever,
  and that their dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to
a__no__ther; *
and call the lands after __their__ own names.

12 Nevertheless, man being in honour abideth __not__, *
seeing he may be compared unto the __beasts__ that perish;

13 This their way is very __fool__ishness; *
yet their posterity __praise__ their saying.

14 They lie in the grave like sheep; death is their shepherd;
  and the righteous shall have dominion over them in the __morn__ing: *
their beauty shall consume in the sepulchre, and have __no__ abiding.

15 But God hath delivered my soul from the power of the __grave__; *
for __he shall__ receive me.

16 Be not thou afraid, though one be made __rich__, *
or if the glory of his __house be__ increased;

17 For he shall carry nothing away with him when he __di__eth, *
neither shall his pomp __fo__llow him.

18 For while he lived, he counted himself an happy __man__; *
and so long as thou doest well unto thyself,
  men __will__ speak good of thee.

19 He shall follow the generation of his __fa__thers, *
and shall __never__ see light.

20 Man that is in honour but hath no under__stand__ing *
is compared unto the __beasts__ that perish.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world without __end__. Amen.
