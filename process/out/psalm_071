4

In thee, O LORD , have I put my trust;
  let me never be __put to con__fusion, *
but rid me and deliver me in thy righteousness;
  incline thine ear un__to me__, and save me.

2 Be thou my stronghold, whereunto I may __alway re__sort: *
thou hast promised to help me,
  for thou art my house of __defence, and__ my castle.

3 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of __the un__godly, *
out of the hand of the __unrighteous__ and cruel man.

4 For thou, O Lord GOD, art the __thing that I__ long for: *
thou art __my hope, even__ from my youth.

5 Through thee have I been holden up ever since __I was__ born: *
thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb:
  my praise shall __be al__way of thee.

6 I am become as it were a monster __unto__ many, *
but my __sure trust__ is in thee.

7 O let my mouth be __filled with thy__ praise, *
that I may sing of thy glory and hon__our all__ the day long.

8 Cast me not away in the __time of__ age; *
forsake me not __when my__ strength faileth me.

9 For mine enemies __speak ag__ainst me; *
and they that lay wait for my soul take their counsel __toge__ther,
saying,

10 God __hath for__saken him; *
persecute him, and take him, for there __is none to__ deliver him.

11 Go not far from __me, O__ God; *
my God, __haste thee__ to help me.

12 Let them be confounded and perish that are a__gainst my__ soul; *
let them be covered with shame and dishonour that seek __to do__ me
evil.

13 As for me, I will patient__ly abide__ alway, *
and __will praise__ thee more and more.

14 My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness __and sal__vation; *
for __I know__ no end thereof.

15 I will go forth in the __strength of the__ Lord G OD , *
and will make mention of __thy righteous__ness only.

16 Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up __until__ now; *
therefore will __I tell of__ thy wondrous works.

17 Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when __I am gray__-
headed, * until I have showed thy strength unto this generation,
  and thy power to all them that __are yet__ for to come.

18 Thy righteousness, O God, is __very__ high, *
and great things are they that thou hast done:
  O God, who __is like__ unto thee!

19 O what great troubles and adversities hast thou showed me!
  and yet didst thou __turn and re__fresh me; *
yea, and broughtest me from __the deep of__ the earth again.

20 Thou hast brought me __to great__ honour, *
and comfort__ed me__ on every side:

21 Therefore will I praise thee, and thy faithfulness, O God,
  playing upon an __instrument of__ music: *
unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O thou Ho__ly One__ of Israel.

22 My lips will be glad when I __sing unto__ thee; *
and so will my soul __whom thou hast__ delivered.

23 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness __all the__ day long; *
for they are confounded and brought unto shame that seek __to do__ me
evil.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
