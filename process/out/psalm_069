2

Save me, O __God__; *
for the waters are come in, even __unto__ my soul.

2 I stick fast in the deep mire, where no __ground__ is; *
I am come into deep waters, so that the __floods__ run over me.

3 I am weary of crying; my throat is __dry__; *
my sight faileth me for waiting so long up__on__ my God.

4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my
__head__; *
they that are mine enemies, and would destroy me __guiltless__, are
mighty.

5 I paid them the things that I never __took__: *
God, thou knowest my simpleness,
  and my faults are not __hid__ from thee.

6 Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord G OD of hosts, be ashamed
for my __cause__; *
let not those that seek thee be confounded through me,
  O Lord __God__ of Israel.

7 And why? for thy sake have I suffered re__proof__; *
shame hath __covered__ my face.

8 I am become a stranger unto my __bre__thren, *
even an alien unto my __mo__ther's children.

9 For the zeal of thine house hath even __ea__ten me; *
and the rebukes of them that rebuked thee are __fallen__ upon me.

10 I wept, and chastened myself with __fast__ing, *
and that was turned to __my__ reproof.

11 I put on sackcloth __al__so, *
and they __jested__ upon me.

12 They that sit in the gate speak a__gainst__ me, *
and the drunkards make __songs__ upon me.

13 But, LORD , I make my prayer unto __thee__ *
in an ac__cepta__ble time.

14 Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy __mer__cy, *
even in the truth of __thy__ salvation.

15 Take me out of the mire, that I sink __not__; *
O let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out __of the__ deep
waters.

16 Let not the water-flood drown me,
  neither let the deep swallow me __up__; *
and let not the pit shut her __mouth__ upon me.

17 Hear me, O LORD , for thy loving-kindness is __com__fortable; *
turn thee unto me according to the multitude __of__ thy mercies.

18 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in __trou__ble: *
O __haste thee__, and hear me.

19 Draw nigh unto my soul, and __save__ it; *
O deliver me, be__cause of__ mine enemies.

20 Thou hast known my reproach, my shame, and my dis__hon__our: *
mine adversaries are all __in__ thy sight.

21 Reproach hath broken my heart;
  I am full of __hea__viness: *
I looked for some to have pity on me, but there was no man,
  neither found I __any__ to comfort me.

22 They gave me gall to __eat__; *
and when I was thirsty they gave me __vinegar__ to drink.

23 Let their table be made a snare to take themselves with__al__; *
and let the things that should have been for their wealth be unto
them an oc__casion__ of falling.

24 Let their eyes be blinded, that they see __not__; *
and ever bow thou __down__ their backs.
25 Pour out thine indignation up__on__ them, *
and let thy wrathful dis__pleasure__ take hold of them.

26 Let their habitation be __void__, *
and no man to __dwell in__ their tents.

27 For they persecute him whom thou hast __smi__tten; *
and they talk how they may vex them whom __thou__ hast wounded.

28 Let them fall from one wickedness to a__no__ther, *
and not come in__to__ thy righteousness.

29 Let them be wiped out of the book of the __liv__ing, *
and not be written am__ong__ the righteous.

30 As for me, when I am poor and in __hea__viness, *
thy help, O God, shall __lift__ me up.

31 I will praise the Name of God with a __song__, *
and magnify it __with__ thanksgiving.

32 This also shall please the __LORD__ *
better than a bullock that hath __horns__ and hoofs.

33 The humble shall consider this, and be __glad__: *
seek ye after God, and your __soul__ shall live.

34 For the LORD heareth the __poor__, *
and despiseth __not__ his prisoners.

35 Let heaven and earth __praise__ him: *
the sea, and all that __moveth__ therein.

36 For God will save Sion, and build the cities of __Ju__dah, *
that men may dwell there, and have it __in__ possession.

37 The posterity also of his servants shall in__he__rit it; *
and they that love his Name shall __dwell__ therein.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world without __end__. Amen.
