7

Are your minds set upon righteousness, O ye __congre__gation? *
and do ye judge the thing that is right, __O ye__ sons of men?

2 Yea, ye imagine mischief in your __heart up__on the earth, *
and your hands __deal with__ wickedness.

3 The ungodly are froward, even __from their__ mother's womb; *
as soon as they are born, they go as__tray, and__ speak lies.

4 They are as venomous as the poison __of a__ serpent, *
even like the deaf adder, that __stop__peth her ears;

5 Which refuseth to hear the __voice of the__ charmer, *
charm he __never so__ wisely.

6 Break their teeth, O __God, in__ their mouths; *
smite the jaw-bones of the __lions__, O LORD .

7 Let them fall away like water that __runneth a__pace; *
when they shoot their arrows, __let them be__ rooted out.

8 Let them consume away like a snail,
  and be like the untimely __fruit of a__ woman; *
and let them __not see__ the sun.

9 Or ever your __pots be made__ hot with thorns, *
he shall take them away with a whirlwind,
  the green and the __burning__ alike.

10 The righteous shall rejoice when he __seeth the__ vengeance; *
he shall wash his footsteps in the __blood of the un__godly.

11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a re__ward for the__ righteous;
* doubtless there is a God that __judgeth__ the earth.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world without__ end. Amen.
