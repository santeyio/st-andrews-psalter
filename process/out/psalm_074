6

O God, wherefore art thou absent from us __so__ long? *
why is thy wrath so hot against __the sheep of__ thy pasture?

2 O think upon thy con__gre__gation, *
whom thou hast pur__chased, and__ redeemed of old.

3 Think upon the tribe of thine __in__heritance, *
and Mount Sion, __wherein__ thou hast dwelt.

4 Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy eve__ry__ enemy, *
which hath done e__vil in__ thy sanctuary.

5 Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy con__gre__gations, *
and set up __their banners__ for tokens.

6 He that hewed timber afore out of the __thick__ trees, *
was known to bring it to __an ex__cellent work.

7 But now they break down all the carved work __there__of *
__with axes__ and hammers.

8 They have set fire upon thy ho__ly__ places, *
and have defiled the dwelling-place of thy Name,
  ev__en un__to the ground.

9 Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them al__to__gether:
* thus have they burnt up all the houses __of God__ in the land.

10 We see not our tokens;
  there is not one pro__phet__ more; *
no, not one is there among us, that und__erstand__eth any more.

11 O God, how long shall the adversary do this __dis__honour? *
shall the enemy blaspheme __thy Name__ for ever?

12 Why withdrawest thou __thy__ hand? *
why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy bosom to __consume__
the enemy?

13 For God is my King __of__ old; *
the help that is done upon earth, __he do__eth it himself.

14 Thou didst divide the sea through __thy__ power; *
thou brakest the heads of the dra__gons in__ the waters.

15 Thou smotest the heads of leviathan __in__ pieces, *
and gavest him to be meat for the peo__ple of__ the wilderness.

16 Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of __the__ hard rocks; *
thou driedst __up mighty__ waters.

17 The day is thine, and the night __is__ thine; *
thou hast prepared __the light__ and the sun.

18 Thou hast set all the borders of __the__ earth; *
thou hast __made summer__ and winter.

19 Remember this, O LORD , how the enemy hath __re__buked; *
and how the foolish people __hath blas__phemed thy Name.

20 O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of
__the__ enemies; *
and forget not the congregation of __the poor__ for ever.

21 Look upon __the co__venant; *
for all the earth is full of darkness __and cruel ha__bitations.

22 O let not the simple go away __a__shamed; *
but let the poor and needy __give praise__ unto thy Name.

23 Arise, O God, maintain thine __own__ cause; *
remember how the foolish __man blasphemeth__ thee daily.

24 Forget not the voice of __thine__ enemies: *
the presumption of them that hate thee increas__eth ev__er more and
more.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Ho__ly__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
