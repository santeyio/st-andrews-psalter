My soul truly waiteth __still up__on God; *
for of him | cometh | my sal- | vation.

2 He verily is my strength and __my sal__vation; *
he is my defence, so that I | shall not | greatly | fall.

3 How long will ye imagine mischief a__gainst ev__ery man? *
Ye shall be slain all the sort of you;
  yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be,
  and | like a | broken | hedge.

4 Their device is only how to put him out whom __God will__ exalt; *
their delight is in lies;
  they give good words with their | mouth, but | curse with | their
heart.

5 Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou __still up__on God; *
for my | hope is | in | him.

6 He truly is my strength and __my sal__vation; *
he is my defence, so that | I shall | not | fall.

7 In God is my __health and my__ glory; *
the rock of my might; | and in | God is | my trust.

8 O put your trust in him __alway, ye__ people; *
pour out your hearts before him, for | God is | our | hope.

9 As for the children of men, they are but vanity;
  the children of __men are de__ceitful; *
upon the weights they are altogether lighter than | vani- | ty it- | self.

10 O trust not in wrong and robbery;
  give not your__selves unto__ vanity: *
if riches increase, set | not your | heart up- | on them.

11 God spake once, and twice I have __also__ heard the same, *
that power be- | longeth | unto | God;

12 And that thou, __Lord, art__ merciful; *
for thou rewardest every man ac- | cording | to his | work.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world | without | end. | Amen.
