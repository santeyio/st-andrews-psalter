7

Give sentence with me, O God,
  and defend my cause against the un__godly__ people; *
O deliver me from the de__ceitful and__ wicked man.

2 For thou art the God of my strength;
  why hast thou __put me__ from thee? *
and why go I so heavily, while the __enemy op__presseth me?

3 O send out thy light and thy truth, that __they may__ lead me, *
and bring me unto thy holy hill, and __to thy__ dwelling;

4 And that I may go unto the altar of God,
  even unto the God of my __joy and__ gladness; *
and upon the harp will I give thanks unto __thee, O__ God, my God.

5 Why art thou so __heavy__, O my soul? *
and why art thou so dis__quieted with__in me?

6 O __put thy__ trust in God; *
for I will yet give him thanks,
  which is the help of my __countenance__, and my God.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world without__ end. Amen.
