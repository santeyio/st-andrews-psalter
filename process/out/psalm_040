5

I waited patiently for the __LORD__ , *
and he inclined unto me, and __heard my__ calling.

2 He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and
__clay__, *
and set my feet upon the rock, and __ordered my__ goings.

3 And he hath put a new song in my __mouth__, *
even a thanksgiving __unto__ our God.

4 Many shall see it, and __fear__, *
and shall put their __trust in__ the LORD .

5 Bless√®d is the man that hath set his hope in the __LORD__ , *
and turned not unto the proud, and to such as __go a__bout with lies.

6 O LORD my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast
done,
  like as be also thy thoughts, which are to __us__-ward; *
and yet there is no man that __ordereth them__ unto thee.

7 If I should declare them, and __speak__ of them, *
they should be more than I am __able__ to express.

8 Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest __not__, *
but mine ears __hast thou__ opened.

9 Burnt-offering and sacrifice for sin hast thou not re__quired__: *
then said __I, Lo__, I come;

10 In the volume of the book it is written of me,
  that I should fulfill thy will, O my __God__: *
I am content to do it;
  yea, thy __law is with__in my heart.

11 I have declared thy righteousness in the great congre__ga__tion: *
lo, I will not refrain my lips, O LORD , and __that thou__ knowest.

12 I have not hid thy righteousness within my __heart__; *
my talk hath been of thy truth, and of __thy sal__vation.

13 I have not kept back thy loving mercy and __truth__ *
from the great __congre__gation.

14 Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O __LORD__ ; *
let thy loving-kindness and thy truth __alway pre__serve me.

15 For innumerable troubles are come about me;
  my sins have taken such hold upon me, that I am not able to look
__up__; *
yea, they are more in number than the hairs of my head,
  and my __heart hath__ failed me.

16 O LORD , let it be thy pleasure to de__li__ver me; *
make haste, O __LORD , to__ help me.

17 Let them be ashamed, and confounded together,
that seek after my soul to des__troy__ it; *
let them be driven backward, and put to rebuke, that __wish me__ evil.

18 Let them be desolate, and rewarded with __shame__, *
that say unto me, Fie upon thee! __fie up__on thee!

19 Let all those that seek thee, be joyful and __glad__ in thee; *
and let such as love thy salvation, say __alway, The__ LORD be praised.

20 As for me, I am poor and __nee__dy; *
but the Lord __careth__ for me.

21 Thou art my helper and re__deem__er; *
make no long __tarrying__, O my God.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world without__ end. Amen.
