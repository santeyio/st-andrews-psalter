4

Help me, LORD , for there is not one __godly man__ left; *
for the faithful are minished from among __the child__ren of men.

2 They talk of vanity every one __with his__ neighbour; *
they do but flatter with their lips,
  and dissem__ble in__ their double heart.

3 The LORD shall root out all de__ceitful__ lips, *
and the tongue __that speak__eth proud things;

4 Which have said, With our tongue will __we pre__vail; *
we are they that ought to speak; who __is lord__ over us?

5 Now, for the comfortless troubles' sake __of the__ needy, *
and because of the __deep sighing__ of the poor,

6 I will up, __saith the__ LORD ; *
and will help every one from him that swelleth against him,
  and __will set__ him at rest.

7 The words of the __LORD are__ pure words; *
even as the silver which from the earth is tried,
  and purified sev__en times__ in the fire.

8 Thou shalt keep __them, O__ LORD ; *
thou shalt preserve them from this g__eneration__ for ever.

9 The ungodly walk on __every__ side: *
when they are exalted, the children of men __are put__ to rebuke.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
