2

I said, I will take heed to my __ways__, *
that I offend not __in__ my tongue

2 I will keep my mouth as it were with a __bri__dle, *
while the ungodly is __in__ my sight.

3 I held my tongue, and spake __no__thing: *
I kept silence, yea, even from good words;
  but it was __pain__ and grief to me.

4 My heart was hot within me:
  and while I was thus musing the fire __kin__dled, *
and at the last I __spake with__ my tongue:

5 LORD , let me know mine end, and the number of my __days__; *
that I may be certified how long I __have__ to live.

6 Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long,
  and mine age is even as nothing in respect of __thee__; *
and verily every man living is alto__geth__er vanity.

7 For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in __vain__; *
he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell __who__ shall gather them.

8 And now, Lord, what is my __hope__? *
truly my hope is __even__ in thee.

9 Deliver me from all mine of__fen__ces; *
and make me not a rebuke un__to__ the foolish.

10 I became dumb, and opened not my __mouth__; *
for it __was__ thy doing.

11 Take thy plague a__way__ from me: *
I am even consumed by the means of thy __hea__vy hand.

12 When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin,
  thou makest his beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth
fretting a __gar__ment: *
every man therefore __is__ but vanity.

13 Hear my prayer, O LORD , and with thine ears consider my __call__ing; * 
hold not thy __peace at__ my tears;

14 For I am a stranger with thee, and a __so__journer, *
as all my __fa__thers were.

15 O spare me a little, that I may recover my __strength__, *
before I go hence, and be __no__ more seen.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world without __end__. Amen.
