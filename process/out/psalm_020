8b

The LORD hear thee in the day of __trou__ble; *
the Name of the God of __Jacob__ defend thee:

2 Send thee help from the __san__ctuary, *
and strengthen thee __out__ of Sion:

3 Remember all thy __off__erings, *
and accept __thy__ burnt-sacrifice:

4 Grant thee thy heart's des__ire__, *
and ful__fill__ all thy mind.

5 We will rejoice in thy salvation,
  and triumph in the Name of the Lord our __God__: *
the LORD perform all __thy__ petitions.

6 Now know I that the LORD helpeth his anointed,
and will hear him from his holy __hea__ven, *
even with the wholesome __strength of__ his right hand.

7 Some put their trust in chariots, and some in __hor__ses; *
but we will remember the Name __of__ the LORD our God.

8 They are brought down and __fall__en; *
but we are risen __and__ stand upright.

9 Save, LORD ; and hear us, O King of __hea__ven, *
when we __call__ upon thee.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world __with__out end. Amen.
