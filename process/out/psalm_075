2

Unto thee, O God, do we give __thanks__; *
yea, unto thee do __we__ give thanks.

2 Thy Name also is so __nigh__; *
and that do thy wondrous __works__ declare.

3 In the appointed time, saith __God__, *
I shall judge according __un__to right.

4 The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters there__of__: *
I bear up the __pil__lars of it.

5 I said unto the fools, Deal not so __mad__ly; *
and to the ungodly, Set not __up__ your horn.

6 Set not up your horn on __high__, *
and speak not __with a__ stiff neck.

7 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the __west__, *
nor yet __from__ the south.

8 And why? God is the __Judge__; *
he putteth down one, and setteth __up__ another.

9 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup,
  and the wine is __red__; *
it is full mixt, and he poureth __out of__ the same.

10 As for the __dregs__ thereof, *
all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and __suck__ them out.

11 But I will talk of the God of __Ja__cob, *
and praise __him__ for ever.

12 All the horns of the ungodly also will I __break__, *
and the horns of the righteous shall __be__ exalted.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world without __end__. Amen.
