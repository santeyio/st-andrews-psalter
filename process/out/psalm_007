8

O LORD my God, in thee have I put my __trust__: *
save me from all them that persecute me, __and__ deliver me;

2 Lest he devour my soul like a lion, and tear it in __pie__ces, *
while __there__ is none to help.

3 O LORD my God, if I have done any such __thing__; *
or if there be any __wicked__ness in my hands;

4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt __friend__ly with me; *
(yea, I have delivered him that without any __cause is__ mine enemy;)

5 Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and __take__ me; *
yea, let him tread my life down upon the earth,
  and lay mine __hon__our in the dust.

6 Stand up, O LORD , in thy wrath,
  and lift up thyself, because of the indignation of mine __en__emies; *
arise up for me in the judgment that __thou hast__ commanded.

7 And so shall the congregation of the peoples come ab__out__ thee: *
for their sakes therefore __lift up__ thyself again.

8 The LORD shall judge the peoples:
  give sentence with me, O LORD , according to my __right__eousness, *
and according to the innocency __that__ is in me.

9 O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an __end__; *
but __guide__ thou the just.

10 For the righteous __God__ *
trieth the __ve__ry hearts and reins.

11 My help cometh of __God__, *
who preserveth __them that__ are true of heart.

12 God is a righteous Judge, strong, and __pat__ient; *
and God is pro__voked__ every day.

13 If a man will not turn, he will whet his __sword__; *
he hath bent his bow, and __made__ it ready.

14 He hath prepared for him the instruments of __death__; *
he ordaineth his arrows a__gainst__ the persecutors.

15 Behold, the ungodly travaileth with i__ni__quity; *
he hath conceived mischief, and __brought__ forth falsehood.

16 He hath graven and digged up a __pit__, *
and is fallen himself into the destruction that he __made__ for other.

17 For his travail shall come upon his own __head__, *
and his wickedness shall fall __on__ his own pate.

18 I will give thanks unto the LORD , according to his __right__eousness;
* and I will praise the __Name of__ the LORD Most High.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
