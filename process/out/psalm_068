praise him in his Name J AH , and rej__oice be__fore him.

5 He is a Father of the fatherless, and defendeth the __cause of the__
widows; *
even God in his holy __habi__tation.

6 He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house,
  and bringeth the prisoners __out of ca__ptivity; *
but letteth the runagates con__tinue in__ scarceness.

7 O God, when thou wentest forth be__fore the__ people; *
when thou wentest __through the__ wilderness,

8 The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the __presence__ of God;
* even as Sinai also was moved at the presence of God,
  who is the __God of__ Israel.

9 Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain up__on thine in__heritance, *
and refreshedst it __when it was__ weary.

10 Thy congreg__ation shall__ dwell therein; *
for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness pre__pared for__ the poor.

11 The __Lord gave__ the word; *
great was the company of women that __bare the__ tidings.

12 Kings with their armies did flee, and __were dis__comfited, *
and they of the household di__vided__ the spoil.

13 Though ye have lain among the sheep-folds,
  yet shall ye be as the __wings of__ a dove *
that is covered with silver wings, and her __feathers__ like gold.

14 When the Almighty scattered __kings for__ their sake, *
then were they as white as __snow__ in Salmon.

15 As the hill of Bashan, __so is__ God's hill; *
even an high hill, as the __hill of__ Bashan.

16 Why mock ye so, ye high hills?
  this is God's hill, in the which it __pleaseth__ him to dwell; *
yea, the LORD will abide in __it for__ ever.

17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even __thousands of__
angels; *
and the Lord is among them as in the holy __place of__ Sinai.

18 Thou art gone up on high,
  thou hast led captivity captive, and re__ceived gifts__ from men; *
yea, even from thine enemies,
  that the LORD God might __dwell a__mong them.

19 Praised be the Lord __dai__ly, *
even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his __benefits__ upon us.

20 He is our God, even the God of whom cometh sal__va__tion: *
GOD is the Lord, by __whom we__ escape death.

21 God shall wound the head of his __en__emies, *
and the hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still __in__ his wickedness.

22 The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from
__Ba__shan; *
mine own will I bring again,
  as I did sometime from the __deep__ of the sea.

23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine __en__emies, *
and that the tongue of thy dogs may be __red__ through the same.

24 It is well seen, O God, how thou __go__est; *
how thou, my God and King, goest __in__ the sanctuary.

25 The singers go before, the minstrels follow __af__ter, *
in the midst of the damsels playing __with__ the timbrels.

26 Give thanks unto God the Lord in the congre__ga__tion, *
ye that are of the __fountain__ of Israel.

27 There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their
__coun__cil; *
the princes of Zebulon, and the __princes__ of Naphthali.

28 Thy God hath sent forth __strength__ for thee; *
stablish the thing, O God, that __thou__ hast wrought in us,

29 For thy temple's sake at Je__ru__salem; *
so shall kings bring __pre__sents unto thee.

30 Rebuke thou the dragon and the bull, with the leaders of the
heathen,
  so that they humbly bring pieces of __si__lver; *
scatter thou the peoples __that__ delight in war;

31 Then shall the princes come out of __Eg__ypt; *
the Morians' land shall soon stretch out her __hands__ unto God.

32 Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the __earth__; *
O sing praises __un__to the Lord;

33 Who sitteth in the heavens over all, from the be__gin__ning: *
lo, he doth send out his voice; yea, and __that__ a mighty voice.

34 Ascribe ye the power to God over __Is__rael; *
his worship and __strength__ is in the clouds.

35 O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy __pla__ces: *
even the God of Israel, he will give strength and power unto his

  __Bless__Ã¨d be God.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
