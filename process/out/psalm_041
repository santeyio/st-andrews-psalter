8b

Blessèd is he that considereth the poor and __nee__dy; *
the LORD shall deliver him in the __time__ of trouble.

2 The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive,
  that he may be blessèd upon __earth__; *
and deliver not thou him into the __will of__ his enemies.

3 The LORD comfort him when he lieth sick upon his __bed__; *
make thou all his bed __in__ his sickness.

4 I said, LORD , be merciful __un__to me; *
heal my soul, for I have __sinned__ against thee.

5 Mine enemies speak __ev__il of me, *
When shall he die, and __his__ name perish?

6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity,
  and his heart conceiveth falsehood within him__self__; *
and when he cometh __forth__, he telleth it.

7 All mine enemies whisper together a__gainst__ me; *
even against me do they im__agine__ this evil.

8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth __fast__ unto him; *
and now that he lieth, he shall __rise__ up no more.

9 Yea, even mine own familiar friend whom I __trust__ed, *
who did also eat of my bread, hath __laid__ great wait for me.

10 But be thou merciful unto me, O __LORD__ ; *
raise thou me up again, and __I shall__ reward them.

11 By this I know thou __fa__vourest me, *
that mine enemy doth not __triumph__ against me.

12 And in my innocency thou up__hold__est me, *
and shalt set me before thy __face__ for ever.
[13 Blessèd be the LORD God of __Is__rael, *
__world with__out end. Amen.]

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
