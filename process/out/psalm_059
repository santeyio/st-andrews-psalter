Deliver me from mine enemies, O __God__; *
defend me from them that __rise up__ against me.

2 O deliver me from the wicked __do__ers, *
and save me from the __blood-thirs__ty men.

3 For lo, they lie waiting for my __soul__; *
the mighty men are gathered against me,
  without any offence or fault of __me__, O LORD .

4 They run and prepare themselves without my __fault__; *
arise thou therefore to help me, __and__ behold.

5 Stand up, O LORD God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the
__hea__then, *
and be not merciful unto them that offend of ma__li__cious wickedness.

6 They go to and fro in the __eve__ning, *
they grin like a dog, and run about __through__ the city.

7 Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their __lips__;
* for __who__ doth hear?

8 But thou, O LORD , shalt have them in de__ri__sion, *
and thou shalt laugh all the __heathen__ to scorn.

9 My strength will I ascribe unto __thee__; *
for thou art the __God of__ my refuge.

10 God showeth me his goodness __plen__teously; *
and God shall let me see my desire up__on__ mine enemies.

11 Slay them not, lest my people forg__et__ it; *
but scatter them abroad among the people,
  and put them down, O __Lord our__ defence.

12 For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips,
  they shall be taken in their __pride__: *
and why? their talk is of __cursing__ and lies.

13 Consume them in thy wrath,
  consume them, that they may __per__ish; *
and know that it is God that ruleth in Jacob,
  and unto the __ends of__ the world.

14 And in the evening they will re__turn__, *
grin like a dog, and will go ab__out__ the city.

15 They will run here and there for __meat__, *
and grudge if they __be__ not satisfied.

16 As for me, I will sing of thy power,
  and will praise thy mercy betimes in the __morn__ing; *
for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the __day of__ my trouble.

17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I __sing__; *
for thou, O God, art my refuge, and my __merci__ful God.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world without __end__. Amen.
