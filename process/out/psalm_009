6

I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD , with my __whole__ heart; *
I will speak of all __thy mar__vellous works.

2 I will be glad and rejoice __in__ thee; *
yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, __O thou__ Most Highest.

3 While mine enemies are driv__en__ back, *
they shall fall and per__ish at__ thy presence.

4 For thou hast maintained my right and __my__ cause; *
thou art set in __the throne__ that judgest right.

5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the __un__godly; *
thou hast put out their name __for ever__ and ever.

6 O thou enemy, thy destructions are come to a perpe__tual__ end; *
even as the cities which thou hast destroyed,
  whose memorial __is per__ished with them.

7 But the LORD shall endure __for__ ever; *
he hath also prepared __his seat__ for judgment.

8 For he shall judge the world __in__ righteousness, *
and minister true judg__ment unto__ the people.

9 The LORD also will be a defence for the __opp__ressed, *
even a refuge in __due__ time of trouble.

10 And they that know thy Name will put their trust __in__ thee; *
for thou, LORD , hast nev__er failed them__ that seek thee.

11 O praise the LORD which dwelleth __in__ Sion; *
show the peo__ple of__ his doings.

12 For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he __re__membereth them, *
and forgetteth not the __comp__laint of the poor.

13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD ;
  consider the trouble which I suffer of them __that__ hate me, *
thou that liftest __me up from__ the gates of death;

14 That I may show all thy praises within the gates of the daughter __of__ Sion: *
I will rejoice __in thy__ salvation.

15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that __they__ made; *
in the same net which they hid privily __is their__ foot taken.

16 The LORD is known to exe__cute__ judgment; *
the ungodly is trapped in __the work of__ his own hands.

17 The wicked shall be turned to __de__struction, *
and all the peo__ple that__ forget God.

18 For the poor shall not alway be __for__gotten; *
the patient abiding of the meek shall __not perish__ for ever.

19 Up, LORD , and let not man have the up__per__ hand; *
let the heathen __be judged__ in thy sight.

20 Put them in fear, __O __LORD , *
that the heathen may know __themselves__ to be but men.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Ho__ly__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
