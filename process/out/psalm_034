5b

I will alway give thanks unto the __LORD__ ; *
his praise shall __ever__ be in my mouth.

2 My soul shall make her boast in the __LORD__ ; *
the humble shall hear there__of__, and be glad.

3 O praise the LORD with __me__, *
and let us magnify his __Name__ together.

4 I sought the LORD , and he __heard__ me; *
yea, he delivered me __out__ of all my fear.

5 They had an eye unto him, and were __light__ened; *
and their __faces__ were not ashamed.

6 Lo, the poor crieth, and the LORD __hear__eth him; *
yea, and saveth him out of __all__ his troubles.

7 The angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that __fear__ him, *
__and__ delivereth them.

8 O taste, and see, how gracious the __LORD__ is: *
bless√®d is the man that __trust__eth in him.

9 O fear the LORD , ye that are his __saints__; *
for they that __fear him__ lack nothing.

10 The lions do lack, and suffer __hun__ger; *
but they who seek the LORD shall want no manner of __thing__ that is good.

11 Come, ye children, and hearken unto __me__; *
I will teach you the __fear__ of the LORD .

12 What man is he that lusteth to __live__, *
and would __fain__ see good days?

13 Keep thy tongue from __ev__il, *
and thy lips, __that__ they speak no guile.

14 Eschew evil, and do __good__; *
seek peace, __and__ ensue it.

15 The eyes of the LORD are over the __right__eous, *
and his ears are open __un__to their prayers.

16 The countenance of the LORD is against them that do __ev__il, *
to root out the remembrance of __them__ from the earth.

17 The righteous cry, and the LORD __hear__eth them, *
and delivereth them out of __all__ their troubles.

18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a contrite __heart__, *
and will save such as be of an __hum__ble spirit.

19 Great are the troubles of the __right__eous; *
but the LORD __delivereth__ him out of all.

20 He keepeth all his __bones__, *
so that not one of __them__ is broken.

21 But misfortune shall slay the un__god__ly; *
and they that hate the righteous __shall__ be desolate.

22 The LORD delivereth the souls of his __ser__vants; *
and all they that put their trust in him shall __not__ be destitute.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world __with__out end. Amen.
