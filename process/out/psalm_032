4

Blessèd is he whose unrighteousness __is forg__iven, *
and __whose sin__ is covered.

2 Blessèd is the man unto whom the LORD im__puteth no__ sin, *
and in __whose spirit__ there is no guile.

3 For whilst I __held my__ tongue, *
my bones consumed away through __my daily__ complaining.

4 For thy hand was heavy upon me __day and__ night, *
and my moisture was like __the drought__ in summer.

5 I acknowledged my sin __unto__ thee; *
and mine unrighteous__ness have__ I not hid.

6 I said, I will confess my sins __unto the__ LORD ; *
and so thou forgavest __the wicked__ness of my sin.

7 For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee,
  in a time when thou __mayest be__ found; *
surely the great water-floods __shall not__ come nigh him.

8 Thou art a place to hide me in;
  thou shalt preserve __me from__ trouble; *
thou shalt compass me about __with songs of__ deliverance.

9 I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein __thou shalt__
go; * and I __will guide__ thee with mine eye.

10 Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no __under__standing; *
whose mouths must be held with bit and bridle,
  else they __will not__ obey thee.

11 Great plagues re__main for the un__godly; *
but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD ,
  mercy embrac__eth him__ on every side.

12 Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice __in the__ LORD ; *
and be joyful, __all ye that__ are true of heart.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
