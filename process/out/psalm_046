5b

God is our hope and __strength__, *
a very present __help__ in trouble.

2 Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be __moved__, *
and though the hills be carried into the __midst__ of the sea;

3 Though the waters thereof rage and __swell__, *
and though the mountains shake at the __tem__pest of the same.

4 There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of __God__; *
the holy place of the tabernacle __of the__ Most Highest.

5 God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be re__moved__; *
God shall help her, and __that__ right early.

6 The nations make much ado, and the kingdoms are __moved__; *
but God hath showed his voice, and the __earth__ shall melt away.

7 The LORD of hosts is __with__ us; *
the God of Jacob __is__ our refuge.

8 O come hither, and behold the works of the __LORD__ , *
what destruction he hath __brought__ upon the earth.

9 He maketh wars to cease in all the __world__; *
he breaketh the bow, and knappeth the spear in sunder,
  and burneth the __cha__riots in the fire.

10 Be still then, and know that I am __God__: *
I will be exalted among the nations,
  and I will be ex__alt__ed in the earth.

11 The LORD of hosts is __with__ us; *
the God of Jacob __is__ our refuge.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world __with__out end. Amen.
