6

Haste thee, O God, to __de__liver me; *
make haste __to help__ me, O LORD .

2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after __my__ soul; *
let them be turned backward and put to confusion __that wish__ me evil.

3 Let them for their reward be soon brought __to__ shame, *
that __cry ov__er me, There! there!

4 But let all those that seek thee be joyful __and__ glad in thee: *
and let all such as delight in thy salvation __say alway__, The Lord be
praised.

5 As for me, I am poor and __in__ misery: *
haste __thee un__to me, O God.

6 Thou art my helper, and my __re__deemer: *
O LORD , __make no__ long tarrying.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Ho__ly__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
