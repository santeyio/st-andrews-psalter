2

Why standest thou so far __off__, O LORD , *
and hidest thy face in the needful __time of__ trouble?

2 The ungodly, for his own lust, doth persecute the __poor__: *
let them be taken in the crafty wiliness that __they have__ imagined.

3 For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's de__sire__, *
and speaketh good of the covetous, whom the __LORD__ abhorreth.

4 The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for __God__, *
neither is God in __all__ his thoughts.

5 His ways are alway __griev__ous; *
thy judgments are far above out of his sight,
  and therefore defieth he __all__ his enemies.

6 For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast __down__, *
there shall no harm happen __un__to me.

7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and __fraud__; *
under his tongue is ungodli__ness__ and vanity.

8 He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the __streets__, *
and privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the innocent;
  his eyes are set a__gainst__ the poor.

9 For he lieth waiting secretly; even as a lion lurketh he in his __den__, *
that he may __ravish__ the poor.

10 He doth ravish the __poor__, *
when he getteth him __into__ his net.

11 He falleth down, and __humb__leth himself, *
that the congregation of the poor may fall into the __hands of__ his
captains.

12 He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath for__got__ten; *
he hideth away his face, and he will __nev__er see it.

13 Arise, O LORD God, and lift up thine __hand__; *
for__get not__ the poor.

14 Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme __God__, *
while he doth say in his heart, Tush, thou God __car__est not for it?

15 Surely thou hast __seen__ it; *
for thou beholdest ungodliness and wrong,
  that thou mayest take the matter __into__ thy hand.

16 The poor committeth himself unto __thee__; *
for thou art the helper __of__ the friendless.

17 Break thou the power of the ungodly and ma__li__cious; *
search out his ungodliness, until __thou__ find none.

18 The LORD is King for ever and __ev__er, *
and the heathen are perished __out of__ the land.

19 LORD , thou hast heard the desire of the __poor__; *
thou preparest their heart, and __thine__ ear hearkeneth;

20 To help the fatherless and poor unto their __right__, *
that the man of the earth be no more ex__alted__ against them.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world without __end__. Amen.
