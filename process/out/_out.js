Blessèd is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nor stood in the way of <u>sin</u>ners, *<br/>
and hath not sat in the <u>seat of</u> the scornful.<br/>
<br/>
2 But his delight is in the law of the <u>LORD</u> ; *<br/>
and in his law will he exercise himself <u>day</u> and night.<br/>
<br/>
3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the <u>wa</u>ter-side, *<br/>
that will bring forth his <u>fruit in</u> due season.<br/>
<br/>
4 His leaf also shall not <u>wi</u>ther; *<br/>
and look, whatsoever he doeth, <u>it</u> shall prosper.<br/>
<br/>
5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with <u>them</u>; *<br/>
but they are like the chaff,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which the wind scattereth away from the <u>face of</u> the earth.<br/>
<br/>
6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the <u>jud</u>gment, *<br/>
neither the sinners in the congregation <u>of</u> the righteous.<br/>

7 But the LORD knoweth the way of the <u>right</u>eous; *<br/>
and the way of the un<u>godly</u> shall perish.<br/>

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy <u>Spi</u>rit; *<br/>

7 For my loins are filled with a <u>sore dis</u>ease, *<br/>
and there is no <u>whole part in</u> my body.<br/>
<br/>
8 I am feeble <u>and sore</u> smitten; *<br/>
I have roared for the very <u>disquiet</u>ness of my heart.<br/>
<br/>
9 Lord, thou knowest <u>all my de</u>sire; *<br/>
and my groan<u>ing is</u> not hid from thee.<br/>
<br/>
10 My heart panteth, my <u>strength hath</u> failed me, *<br/>
and the light of <u>mine eyes</u> is gone from me.<br/>
<br/>
11 My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking up<u>on my</u> trouble,<br/>
* and my kins<u>men stood</u> afar off.<br/>
<br/>
12 They also that sought after my <u>life laid</u> snares for me; *<br/>
and they that went about to do me evil talked of wickedness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and imagined <u>deceit all</u> the day long.<br/>
<br/>
13 As for me, I was like a deaf <u>man, and</u> heard not; *<br/>
and as one that is dumb, who doth <u>not op</u>en his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
14 I became even as a man that <u>heareth</u> not, *<br/>
and in <u>whose mouth</u> are no reproofs.<br/>
<br/>
15 For in thee, O LORD , have I <u>put my</u> trust; *<br/>
thou shalt answer <u>for me</u>, O Lord my God.<br/>
<br/>
16 I have required that they, even mine enemies, should not <u>triumph</u><br/>
over me; *<br/>
for when my foot slipt, they rej<u>oiced greatly</u> against me.<br/>
<br/>
17 And I truly am set <u>in the</u> plague, *<br/>
and my heaviness <u>is ev</u>er in my sight.<br/>
<br/>
18 For I will con<u>fess my</u> wickedness, *<br/>
and <u>be sor</u>ry for my sin.<br/>
<br/>
19 But mine enemies live, <u>and are</u> mighty; *<br/>
and they that hate me wrongfully <u>are many</u> in number.<br/>
<br/>
20 They also that reward evil for good <u>are a</u>gainst me; *<br/>
because I follow <u>the thing</u> that good is.<br/>
<br/>
21 Forsake me not, O <u>LORD my</u> God; *<br/>
<u>be not</u> thou far from me.<br/>
<br/>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the <u>Holy</u> Spirit; *<br/>
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>world with</u>out end. Amen.<br/>
