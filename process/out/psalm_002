4

Why do the heathen so furiously __rage to__gether? *
and why do the people __imagine__ a vain thing?

2 The kings of the earth stand up,
  and the rulers take __counsel to__gether *
against the LORD , and __against his__ Anointed:

3 Let us break their __bonds a__sunder, *
and cast __away__ their cords from us.

4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh __them to__ scorn: *
the Lord shall have __them in__ derision.

5 Then shall he speak unto them __in his__ wrath, *
and vex them in __his sore__ displeasure:

6 Yet have I __set my__ King *
upon my ho__ly hill__ of Sion.

7 I will rehearse __the de__cree; *
the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son,
  this day __have I__ begotten thee.

8 Desire of me, and I shall give thee the nations for __thine in__heritance, * 
and the utmost parts of the earth __for thy__ possession.

9 Thou shalt bruise them with a __rod of__ iron, *
and break them in pieces like __a pot__ter's vessel.

10 Be wise now therefore, __O ye__ kings; *
be instructed, ye that __are jud__ges of the earth.

11 Serve the __LORD in__ fear, *
and rejoice un__to him__ with reverence.

12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry,
  and so ye perish from the right way,
  if his wrath be kindled, yea __but a__ little. *
Bless√®d are all they __that put__ their trust in him.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the __Holy__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
