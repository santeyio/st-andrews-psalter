5

Truly God is loving unto __Is__rael: *
even unto such as are __of a__ clean heart.

2 Nevertheless, my feet were almost __gone__, *
my treadings __had well__-nigh slipt.

3 And why? I was grieved at the __wi__cked: *
I do also see the ungodly in __such pro__sperity.

4 For they are in no peril of __death__; *
but are __lusty__ and strong.

5 They come in no misfortune like other __folk__; *
neither are they __plagued like__ other men.

6 And this is the cause that they are so holden with __pride__, *
and cruelty covereth them __as a__ garment.

7 Their eyes swell with __fat__ness, *
and they do __even__ what they lust.

8 They corrupt other, and speak of wicked __blas__phemy; *
their talking is a__gainst the__ Most High.

9 For they stretch forth their mouth unto the __hea__ven, *
and their tongue __goeth__ through the world.

10 Therefore fall the people __un__to them, *
and thereout suck they no __small ad__vantage.

11 Tush, say they, how should God per__ceive__ it? *
is there knowledge __in the__ Most High?

12 Lo, these are the un__god__ly, *
these prosper in the world, and these have riches __in pos__session:

13 And I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in __vain__, *
and washed my __hands in__ innocency.

14 All the day long have I been __pun__ished, *
and chastened __every__ morning.

15 Yea, and I had almost said even as __they__; *
but lo, then I should have condemned the generation __of thy__ children.

16 Then thought I to under__stand__ this; *
but it __was too__ hard for me,

17 Until I went into the sanctuary of __God__: *
then understood I the __end of__ these men;

18 Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery __pla__ces, *
and castest them down, __and de__stroyest them.

19 O how suddenly do they con__sume__, *
perish, and __come to a__ fearful end!

20 Yea, even like as a dream when one a__wa__keth; *
so shalt thou make their image to vanish __out of the__ city.

21 Thus my heart was __grieved__, *
and it went __even__ through my reins.

22 So foolish was I, and __ig__norant, *
even as it were a __beast__ before thee.

23 Nevertheless, I am alway __by__ thee; *
for thou hast holden me __by my__ right hand.

24 Thou shalt guide me with thy __couns__el, *
and after that re__ceive me with__ glory.

25 Whom have I in heaven but __thee__? *
and there is none upon earth that I desire in com__parison__ of thee.

26 My flesh and my heart __fail__eth; *
but God is the strength of my heart, and my __portion for__ ever.

27 For lo, they that forsake thee shall __per__ish; *
thou hast destroyed all them that are un__faithful__ unto thee.

28 But it is good for me to hold me fast by God,
  to put my trust in the __Lord__ GOD , *
and to speak of all thy works in the gates of the __daughter of__ Sion.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world without__ end. Amen.
