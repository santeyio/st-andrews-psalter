6

I will magnify thee, O LORD ; for thou hast set __me__ up, *
and not made my foes __to tri__umph over me.

2 O LORD my God, I cried un__to__ thee; *
__and thou__ hast healed me.

3 Thou, LORD , hast brought my soul out __of__ hell: *
thou hast kept my life, that I should not __go down__ into the pit.

4 Sing praises unto the LORD , O ye saints __of__ his; *
and give thanks unto him, for a remem__brance of__ his holiness.

5 For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye,
and in his pleasure __is__ life; *
heaviness may endure for a night,
  but joy com__eth in__ the morning.

6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be __re__moved: *
thou, LORD , of thy goodness, __hast made__ my hill so strong.

7 Thou didst turn __thy__ face from me, *
__and I__ was troubled.

8 Then cried I unto thee, __O__ LORD ; *
and gat me to __my LORD__ right humbly.

9 What profit is there in __my__ blood, *
when I __go down__ into the pit?

10 Shall the dust give thanks un__to__ thee? *
__or shall it__ declare thy truth?

11 Hear, O LORD , and have mercy __up__on me; *
LORD , __be thou__ my helper.

12 Thou hast turned my heaviness in__to__ joy; *
thou hast put off my sackcloth, and gird__ed me__ with gladness:

13 Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise with__out__
ceasing. * O my God, I will give thanks un__to thee__ for ever.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Ho__ly__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
