5b

In the LORD put I my __trust__; *
how say ye then to my soul,
  that she should flee as a __bird__ unto the hill?

2 For lo, the ungodly bend their bow,
  and make ready their arrows within the __qui__ver, *
that they may privily shoot at __them which__ are true of heart.

3 If the foundations be des__troyed__, *
what __can__ the righteous do?

4 The LORD is in his holy __tem__ple; *
the LORD ' S seat __is__ in heaven.

5 His eyes consider the __poor__, *
and his eyelids try the __chil__dren of men.

6 The LORD approveth the __right__eous: *
but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in wickedness,
  __doth__ his soul abhor.

7 Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares,
  fire and brimstone, storm and __tem__pest: *
this shall be their __por__tion to drink.

8 For the righteous LORD loveth __right__eousness; *
his countenance will behold the __thing__ that is just.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spir__it; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world __with__out end. Amen.
