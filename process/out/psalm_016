6

Preserve me, __O__ God; *
for in __thee have__ I put my trust.

2 O my soul, thou hast said unto __the__ LORD , *
Thou art my God; I have no __good like__ unto thee.

3 All my delight is upon the saints that are in __the__ earth, *
and upon such as __excel__ in virtue.

4 But they that run after anoth__er__ god *
__shall have__ great trouble.

5 Their drink-offerings of blood will I __not__ offer, *
neither make mention of __their names__ within my lips.

6 The LORD himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of __my__ cup; *
__thou shalt__ maintain my lot.

7 The lot is fallen unto me in a __fair__ ground; *
yea, I have __a goodly__ heritage.

8 I will thank the LORD for giving __me__ warning; *
my reins also chasten __me in the__ night season.

9 I have set the LORD alway __be__fore me; *
for he is on my right hand, __therefore__ I shall not fall.

10 Wherefore my heart is glad, and my glory __re__joiceth: *
my flesh __also__ shall rest in hope.

11 For why? thou shalt not leave my soul __in__ hell; *
neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy One __to see__ corruption.

12 Thou shalt show me the path of life:
  in thy presence is the fulness __of__ joy, *
and at thy right hand there __is pleasure__ for evermore.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Ho__ly__ Spirit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
