8

Like as the hart desireth the __wa__ter-brooks, *
so longeth my soul __af__ter thee, O God.

2 My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living __God__: *
when shall I come to appear before the __pre__sence of God?

3 My tears have been my meat day and __night__, *
while they daily say unto me,
  __Where__ is now thy God?

4 Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by my__self__; *
for I went with the multitude,
  and brought them forth in__to__ the house of God;

5 In the voice of praise and thanks__giv__ing, *
among __such as__ keep holy-day.

6 Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my __soul__? *
and why art thou so dis__quieted__ within me?

7 O put thy trust in __God__; *
for I will yet thank him,
  which is the help of my __counte__nance, and my God.

8 My soul is vexed with__in__ me; *
therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan,
  from Hermon __and__ the little hill.

9 One deep calleth another, because of the noise of thy __wa__ter-floods;
* all thy waves and storms __are__ gone over me.

10 The LORD will grant his loving-kindness in the __day__time; *
and in the night season will I sing of him,
  and make my prayer unto the __God__ of my life.

11 I will say unto the God of my strength,
  Why hast thou for__got__ten me? *
why go I thus heavily, while the __enemy__ oppresseth me?

12 My bones are smitten asunder as with a __sword__, *
while mine enemies that trouble me __cast__ me in the teeth;

13 Namely, while they say daily __un__to me, *
__Where__ is now thy God?

14 Why art thou so vexed, O my __soul__? *
and why art thou so dis__quieted__ within me?

15 O put thy trust in __God__; *
for I will yet thank him,
  which is the help of my __counte__nance, and my God.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
