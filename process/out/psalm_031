5

In thee, O LORD , have I put my trust;
  let me never be put to con__fu__sion; *
deliver me __in thy__ righteousness.

2 Bow down thine __ear__ to me; *
make __haste to de__liver me.

3 And be thou my strong rock, and house of de__fence__, *
that thou __mayest__ save me.

4 For thou art my strong rock, and my __cas__tle: *
be thou also my guide, and lead me __for thy__ Name's sake.

5 Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily __for__ me; *
for __thou art__ my strength.

6 Into thy hands I commend my __spi__rit; *
for thou hast redeemed me, O __LORD , thou__ God of truth.

7 I have hated them that hold of lying __van__ities, *
and my trust hath __been in__ the LORD .

8 I will be glad and rejoice in thy __mer__cy; *
for thou hast considered my trouble, and hast known my __soul in__
__ad__versities.

9 Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the __en__emy; *
but hast set my __feet in a__ large room.

10 Have mercy upon me, O LORD , for I am in __trou__ble, *
and mine eye is consumed for very heaviness;
  yea, my __soul and my__ body.

11 For my life is waxen old with __hea__viness, *
and my __years with__ mourning.

12 My strength faileth me, because of mine in__i__quity, *
and my __bones are__ consumed.

13 I became a reproach among all mine enemies,
  but especially among my __neigh__bours; *
and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me;
  and they that did see me without, con__veyed themselves__ from me.

14 I am clean forgotten as a dead man out of __mind__; *
I am become like a __broken__ vessel.

15 For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude,
  and fear is on every __side__; *
while they conspire together against me,
  and take their counsel to __take a__way my life.

16 But my hope hath been in thee, O __LORD__ ; *
I have said, __Thou art__ my God.

17 My times are in thy hand;
  deliver me from the hand of mine __en__emies, *
and from __them that__ persecute me.

18 Show thy servant the light of thy __count__enance, *
and save me __for thy__ mercy's sake.

19 Let me not be confounded, O LORD , for I have called up__on__ thee; *
let the ungodly be put to confusion,
  and be put to __silence__ in the grave.

20 Let the lying lips be put to __sil__ence, *
which cruelly, disdainfully, and despitefully speak a__gainst the__
righteous.

21 O how plentiful is thy goodness,
  which thou hast laid up for them that __fear__ thee, *
and that thou hast prepared for them that put their trust in thee,
  even be__fore the__ sons of men!

22 Thou shalt hide them in the covert of thine own presence from
the plottings of __men__: *
thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle __from the__ strife of
tongues.

23 Thanks be to the __LORD__ ; *
for he hath showed me marvellous great kindness __in a strong__ city.

24 But in my haste I __said__, *
I am cast out of the __sight of__ thine eyes.

25 Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my __prayer__, *
when I __cried un__to thee.

26 O love the LORD , all ye his __saints__; *
for the LORD preserveth them that are faithful,
  and plenteously re__wardeth the proud__ doer.

27 Be strong, and he shall establish your __heart__, *
all ye that put your __trust in__ the LORD .

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world without__ end. Amen.
