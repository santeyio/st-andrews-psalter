8

My heart showeth me the wickedness of the un__godl__y, *
that there is no fear of __God__ before his eyes.

2 For he flattereth himself in his own __sight__, *
until his abominable __sin__ be found out.

3 The words of his mouth are unrighteous and full of de__ceit__: *
he hath left off to behave himself wisely, __and__ to do good.

4 He imagineth mischief upon his bed,
  and hath set himself in no good __way__; *
neither doth he abhor any __thing that__ is evil.

5 Thy mercy, O LORD , reacheth unto the __heav__ens, *
and thy faithfulness __un__to the clouds.

6 Thy righteousness standeth like the strong __moun__tains: *
thy judgments are __like__ the great deep.

7 Thou, LORD , shalt save both man and beast:
  how excellent is thy mercy, O __God__! *
and the children of men shall put their trust under the __sha__dow of thy
wings.

8 They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy __house__; *
and thou shalt give them drink of thy pleasures, as __out of__ the river.

9 For with thee is the well of __life__; *
and in thy __light__ shall we see light.

10 O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that __know__ thee, *
and thy righteousness unto them __that__ are true of heart.

11 O let not the foot of pride come a__gainst__ me; *
and let not the hand of the un__godly__ cast me down.

12 There are they fallen, all that work __wi__ckedness; *
they are cast down, and shall not be __ab__le to stand.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
