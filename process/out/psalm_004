8

Hear me when I call, O God of my __right__eousness: *
thou hast set me at liberty when I was in trouble;
  have mercy upon me, and hearken __un__to my prayer.

2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine __hon__our, *
and have such pleasure in vanity, and __seek af__ter falsehood?

3 Know this also,
  that the LORD hath chosen to himself the man that is __god__ly; *
when I call upon the LORD he will hear me.

4 Stand in awe, and sin __not__; *
commune with your own heart, and in your __cham__ber, and be still.

5 Offer the sacrifice of __right__eousness, *
and put your __trust__ in the LORD .

6 There be many that __say__, *
Who will __show__ us any good?

7 LORD , lift thou __up__ *
the light of thy __countenance__ upon us.

8 Thou hast put gladness in my __heart__; *
yea, more than when their corn and __wine__ and oil increase.

9 I will lay me down in peace, and take my __rest__; *
for it is thou, LORD , only, that makest me __dwell__ in safety.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
