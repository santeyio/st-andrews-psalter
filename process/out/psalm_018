5

I will love thee, O LORD , my __strength__. *
The LORD is my stony __rock, and__ my defence;

2 My Saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will __trust__; *
my buckler, the horn also of my salvation, __and my__ refuge.

3 I will call upon the LORD , which is worthy to be __praised__; *
so shall I be __safe from mine__ enemies.

4 The sorrows of death __com__passed me, *
and the overflowings of ungodliness __made me__ afraid.

5 The pains of hell came ab__out__ me; *
the snares of death __over__took me.

6 In my trouble I called upon the __LORD__ , *
and complained __unto__ my God:

7 So he heard my voice out of his holy __tem__ple, *
and my complaint came before him; it entered even __into__ his ears.

[tone_4]

8 The earth __trembled and__ quaked, *
the very foundations also of the hills shook, and were removed,
  __because__ he was wroth.

9 There went a smoke out __in his__ presence, *
and a consuming fire out of his mouth, so that coals __were kin__dled at
it.

10 He bowed the heavens also, __and came__ down, *
and it __was dark__ under his feet.

11 He rode upon the Cherubim, __and did__ fly; *
he came flying upon __the wings__ of the wind.

12 He made darkness his __secret__ place, *
his pavilion round about him with dark water,
  and __thick clouds__ to cover him.

13 At the brightness of his presence his __clouds re__moved; *
__hailstones__ and coals of fire.

14 The LORD also thundered out of heaven,
  and the Highest __gave his__ thunder; *
__hailstones__ and coals of fire.

15 He sent out his __arrows, and__ scattered them; *
he cast forth lightnings, and destroyed them.

16 The springs of waters were seen,
  and the foundations of the round world __were dis__covered, *
at thy chiding, O LORD ,
  at the blasting of the breath __of thy__ displeasure.

17 He sent down from on __high to__ fetch me, *
and took me out __of many__ waters.

18 He delivered me from my strongest enemy,
  and from __them which__ hate me; *
for they were __too migh__ty for me.

19 They came upon me in the day __of my__ trouble; *
but the LORD __was my__ upholder.

20 He brought me forth also into a __place of__ liberty; *
he brought me forth, even because he had __a fa__vour unto me.

[tone6]

21 The LORD rewarded me after my right__eous__ dealing, *
according to the cleanness of __my hands did__ he recompense me.

22 Because I have kept the ways of __the__ LORD , *
and have not forsaken my __God, as__ the wicked doth.

23 For I have an eye unto all __his__ laws, *
and will not cast out his __command__ments from me.

24 I was also uncorrupt __be__fore him, *
and esc__hewed mine__ own wickedness.

25 Therefore the LORD rewarded me after my right__eous__ dealing, *
and according unto the cleanness of __my hands in__ his eyesight.

26 With the holy thou shalt __be__ holy, *
and with a perfect man __thou shalt__ be perfect.

27 With the clean thou shalt __be__ clean, *
and with the froward __thou shalt__ be froward.

28 For thou shalt save the people that are in __ad__versity,
and shalt bring down __the high__ looks of the proud.

29 Thou also shalt light __my__ candle; *
the LORD my God shall make __my dark__ness to be light.

30 For in thee I shall discomfit an host __of__ men, *
and with the help of my God I shall __leap ov__er the wall.

31 The way of God is an undefil__ed__ way: *
the word of the LORD also is tried in the fire;
  he is the defender of all them __that put__ their trust in him.

32 For who is God, but __the__ LORD ? *
or who hath an__y strength__, except our God?

33 It is God that girdeth me with strength __of__ war, *
and mak__eth my__ way perfect.

34 He maketh my feet __like__ harts' feet, *
__and setteth__ me up on high.

35 He teacheth mine hands __to__ fight, *
and mine arms shall __bend even__ a bow of steel.

[tone5b]

36 Thou hast given me the defence of thy sal__va__tion; *
thy right hand also shall hold me up,
  and thy loving cor__rection__ shall make me great.

37 Thou shalt make room enough under me for to __go__, *
that my __foot__steps shall not slide.

38 I will follow upon mine enemies, and over__take__ them; *
neither will I turn again till I __have__ destroyed them.

39 I will smite them, that they shall not be able to __stand__, *
but fall __un__der my feet.

40 Thou hast girded me with strength unto the __bat__tle; *
thou shalt throw down mine __enem__ies under me.

41 Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs up__on__ me, *
and I shall destroy __them__ that hate me.

42 They shall cry, but there shall be none to __help__ them; *
yea, even unto the LORD shall they cry,
  but he __shall__ not hear them.

43 I will beat them as small as the dust before the __wind__: *
I will cast them out as the __clay__ in the streets.

44 Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the __peo__ple, *
and thou shalt make me the head of the nations;
  a people whom I have not __known__ shall serve me.

45 As soon as they hear of me, they shall o__bey__ me; *
the strangers shall feign ob__edi__ence unto me.

46 The strangers shall __fail__, *
and come trembling __out of__ their strongholds.

47 The LORD liveth; and bless√®d be my strong __help__er, *
and praised be the God of __my__ salvation;

48 Even the God that seeth that I be av__enged__, *
and subdueth the __peo__ple unto me.

49 It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies,
  and setteth me up above mine __ad__versaries: *
thou shalt rid me __from__ the wicked man.

50 For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD , among the __Gen__tiles, *
and sing praises __un__to thy Name.

51 Great prosperity giveth he unto his __King__, *
and showeth loving-kindness unto David his anointed, and unto his
__seed__ for evermore.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  world __with__out end. Amen.
