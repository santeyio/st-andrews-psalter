8

Unto thee will I cry, O LORD , my __strength__: *
think no scorn of me;
  lest, if thou make as though thou hearest not,
  I become like them that go __down__ into the pit.

2 Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto __thee__; *
when I hold up my hands towards the mercy-seat of thy __ho__ly temple.

3 O pluck me not away,
  neither destroy me with the ungodly and wicked __do__ers, *
which speak friendly to their neighbours,
  but imagine __mis__chief in their hearts.

4 Reward them according to their __deeds__, *
and according to the wickedness of their __own__ inventions.

5 Recompense them after the work of their __hands__; *
pay them __that__ they have deserved.

6 For they regard not in their mind the works of the LORD ,
  nor the operation of his __hands__; *
therefore shall he break them down, __and__ not build them up.

7 Praised be the __LORD__ ; *
for he hath heard the voice of my __humble__ petitions.

8 The LORD is my strength, and my shield;
  my heart hath trusted in him, and I am __helped__; *
therefore my heart danceth for joy,
  and in my song __will__ I praise him.

9 The LORD is my __strength__, *
and he is the wholesome defence of __his__ anointed.

10 O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine in__her__itance: *
feed them, and set them __up__ for ever.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy __Spi__rit; *
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
  __world with__out end. Amen.
