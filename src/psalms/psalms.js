Blessèd is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nor stood in the way of <u>sin</u>ners, *<br/>
and hath not sat in the <u>seat of</u> the scornful.<br/>
<br/>
2 But his delight is in the law of the <u>LORD</u> ; *<br/>
and in his law will he exercise himself <u>day</u> and night.<br/>
<br/>
3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the <u>wa</u>ter-side, *<br/>
that will bring forth his <u>fruit in</u> due season.<br/>
<br/>
4 His leaf also shall not <u>wi</u>ther; *<br/>
and look, whatsoever he doeth, <u>it</u> shall prosper.<br/>
<br/>
5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with <u>them</u>; *<br/>
but they are like the chaff,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which the wind scattereth away from the <u>face of</u> the earth.<br/>
<br/>
6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the <u>jud</u>gment, *<br/>
neither the sinners in the congregation <u>of</u> the righteous.<br/>
<br/>
7 But the LORD knoweth the way of the <u>right</u>eous; *<br/>
and the way of the un<u>godly</u> shall perish.<br/>
<br/>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy <u>Spi</u>rit; *<br/>
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;world without <u>end</u>. Amen.<br/>

Why do the heathen so furiously <u>rage to</u>gether? *<br/>
and why do the people <u>imagine</u> a vain thing?<br/>
<br/>
2 The kings of the earth stand up,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rulers take <u>counsel to</u>gether *<br/>
against the LORD , and <u>against his</u> Anointed:<br/>
<br/>
3 Let us break their <u>bonds a</u>sunder, *<br/>
and cast <u>away</u> their cords from us.<br/>
<br/>
4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh <u>them to</u> scorn: *<br/>
the Lord shall have <u>them in</u> derision.<br/>
<br/>
5 Then shall he speak unto them <u>in his</u> wrath, *<br/>
and vex them in <u>his sore</u> displeasure:<br/>
<br/>
6 Yet have I <u>set my</u> King *<br/>
upon my ho<u>ly hill</u> of Sion.<br/>
<br/>
7 I will rehearse <u>the de</u>cree; *<br/>
the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;this day <u>have I</u> begotten thee.<br/>
<br/>
8 Desire of me, and I shall give thee the nations for <u>thine in</u>heritance, *<br/>
and the utmost parts of the earth <u>for thy</u> possession.<br/>
<br/>
9 Thou shalt bruise them with a <u>rod of</u> iron, *<br/>
and break them in pieces like <u>a pot</u>ter's vessel.<br/>
<br/>
10 Be wise now therefore, <u>O ye</u> kings; *<br/>
be instructed, ye that <u>are jud</u>ges of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
11 Serve the <u>LORD in</u> fear, *<br/>
and rejoice un<u>to him</u> with reverence.<br/>
<br/>
12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and so ye perish from the right way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if his wrath be kindled, yea <u>but a</u> little. *<br/>
Blessèd are all they <u>that put</u> their trust in him.<br/>
<br/>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the <u>Holy</u> Spirit; *<br/>
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br/>

thou art my worship, and the lift<u>er up</u> of my head.<br/>

Hear me when I call, O God of my <u>right</u>eousness: *<br/>
thou hast set me at liberty when I was in trouble;<br/>

Ponder my words, O <u>LORD</u> , *<br/>
consider my <u>med</u>itation.<br/>
<br/>
2 O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my<br/>
God: * for unto thee will I <u>make</u> my prayer.<br/>
<br/>
3 My voice shalt thou hear be<u>times</u>, O LORD ; *<br/>
early in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and <u>will</u> look up.<br/>
<br/>
4 For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in <u>wic</u>kedness; *<br/>
neither shall any evil <u>dwell</u> with thee.<br/>
<br/>
5 Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy <u>sight</u>; *<br/>
for thou hatest all them that <u>work</u> iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak <u>lies</u>: *<br/>
the LORD will abhor both the blood-thirsty and de<u>ceit</u>ful man.<br/>
<br/>
7 But as for me, in the multitude of thy mercy I will come into thine <u>house</u>; *<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and in thy fear will I worship toward thy <u>ho</u>ly temple.<br/>
<br/>
8 Lead me, O LORD , in thy righteousness, because of mine <u>en</u>emies; *<br/>
make thy way plain be<u>fore</u> my face.<br/>
<br/>
9 For there is no faithfulness in their <u>mouth</u>; *<br/>
their inward parts are <u>ve</u>ry wickedness.<br/>
<br/>
10 Their throat is an open <u>sep</u>ulchre; *<br/>
they flatter <u>with</u> their tongue.<br/>
<br/>
11 Destroy thou them, O God;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;let them perish through their own imagi<u>na</u>tions; *<br/>
cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for they have re<u>belled</u> against thee.<br/>

they shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;they that love thy Name shall be <u>joyful</u> in thee;<br/>
<br/>
13 For thou, LORD , wilt give thy blessing unto the <u>right</u>eous, *<br/>
and with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defend him as <u>with</u> a shield.<br/>
