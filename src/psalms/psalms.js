Blessèd is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nor stood in the way of <u>sin</u>ners, *<br/>
and hath not sat in the <u>seat of</u> the scornful.<br/>
<br/>
2 But his delight is in the law of the <u>LORD</u> ; *<br/>
and in his law will he exercise himself <u>day</u> and night.<br/>
<br/>
3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the <u>wa</u>ter-side, *<br/>
that will bring forth his <u>fruit in</u> due season.<br/>
<br/>
4 His leaf also shall not <u>wi</u>ther; *<br/>
and look, whatsoever he doeth, <u>it</u> shall prosper.<br/>
<br/>
5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with <u>them</u>; *<br/>
but they are like the chaff,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which the wind scattereth away from the <u>face of</u> the earth.<br/>
<br/>
6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the <u>jud</u>gment, *<br/>
neither the sinners in the congregation <u>of</u> the righteous.<br/>

7 But the LORD knoweth the way of the <u>right</u>eous; *<br/>
and the way of the un<u>godly</u> shall perish.<br/>

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy <u>Spi</u>rit; *<br/>

and my heart is joyful in <u>thy</u> salvation.<br/>
